Unfortunately, pawns that are crafting cannot participate in the search as a pawn expedition. It is only natural.
^^^^
My beautiful Lord, where are you going to explore today?
^^^^
Oy! My Lord, I've already sent you to spot search today, so it seems that you can't participate in the search anymore  - but I don't dislike that forward-thinking attitude!
^^^^
Well, then, let me go explore.
^^^^
Oh dear, Lord Arisen you don't have any<VAL>pieces available I'm afraid I can't give you the results of the expedition.
^^^^
Dear Lord Arisen, I went to 《<VAL SPOT>》to explore. Yeah, and then to <VAL EMNAME>. <VAL>I completed a subjugation of the enemy and such.
^^^^
I just got back from<VAL SPOT> <VAL EMNAME><VAL>I subjugated some enemies -- is that okay?
^^^^
The <VAL EMNAME>were a bit of a distraction from my search at <VAL SPOT>for them, so I killed about <VAL>of them, my Lord.
^^^^
We searched<VAL SPOT> and came across a treasure--of course we got it. Now, which is our next prey?
^^^^
Please receive this wonderful treasure from<VAL SPOT>. We are sure that it will take you to a state of euphoria.
^^^^
My Lord--As per your earlier order, I have searched <VAL SPOT> for this treasure that I found along the way--though I paid a bit of a price to obtain it--as an achievement. Please accept it.
^^^^
Oh, and there seems to be an anomaly in the 《<VAL SPOT>》 Why don't you and your clan members go and explore?
^^^^
My Lord, my wise Lord-- You did not forget to take the results of the expedition, did you?
^^^^
Now, my Lord -- since you have spoken to me here you must have a very important mission -- and how can I help you?
^^^^
We wish you a safe and healthy day...
^^^^
It's a great base-- It's a place where the glory of the Lord of the Arisen is engraved
^^^^
This is such a large base-- I fantasize about what if there was a hidden room... It wouldn't be a bad idea to go explore or go back to your childhood!
^^^^
Ah, Lord Arisen! I can't explore the spot unless I buy a "Pawn Expedition" from the clan store!
^^^^
Sorry, Arisen-- Pawns that are crafting can't go to explore the pawn expedition!
^^^^
Lord Arisen!　Where would you like to explore today?
^^^^
It looks like I've already explored a spot today, so I can't go exploring any more--sorry!
^^^^
I'm off! Please expect some souvenirs from me, Lord Arisen!
^^^^
Oh, Arisen, if you don't empty<VAL>spots, I can't give you the results of the expedition!
^^^^
I've been exploring<VAL SPOT>! I've been killing some <VAL EMNAME>, <VAL> of them. Hehe, how do you like it?　Are you happy?
^^^^
I've been exploring 《<VAL SPOT>》 I took down<VAL EMNAME><VAL>! Oh, my God, I was afraid of what would happen--
^^^^
I went to 《<VAL SPOT>》 to search for them and fought against <VAL EMNAME>, as ordered by My Lord! I've successfully defeated <VAL>!
^^^^
I've been exploring<VAL SPOT>! And I found a treasure. I'm going to give it to you. I'm sure it's very valuable!
^^^^
I'm back, Master! During my search for<VAL SPOT> I found a treasure, so I'll give it to you as a souvenir!
^^^^
Phew, I'm back from 《<VAL SPOT>》 I was a bit reckless, but-- I found a treasure, so I brought it back I hope the Master will be pleased.
^^^^
Oh, by the way, Master! <VAL SPOT>It seems that there is something strange happening in 《COPY00》 Let's explore it together with all the clan members!
^^^^
Dear Arisen, did you forget to get the results of the expedition? Please accept our efforts!
^^^^
Hi, it's me!　It's me, the Masters pawn! So, what can I do for you?
^^^^
Please come back today with no injuries and in good spirits!
^^^^
Master -- me -- I thought I got lost!
^^^^
It's kind of big and spacious and exciting! There may be a hidden room or something... Hey, Master!　Wanna race me to see who can get to the top faster?
^^^^
Sorry, Master, but you have to buy a "Pawn Expedition" from the clan store or you won't be able to explore the spot-- let's buy it quickly and easily!
^^^^
Oops, Arisen - pawns in crafting cannot participate in the search as a pawn expedition. We pawns have only one body, after all.
^^^^
Now, where should I go to explore today?
^^^^
Oh, Arisen, I've already explored a spot today, so I can't go exploring any more--sorry!
^^^^
Well, let's go exploring for a bit!
^^^^
Dear Master, I don't have <VAL> free slots on hand, so I won't be able to receive the results of this expedition.
^^^^
I went to<VAL SPOT> as you ordered me to and beat the shit out of<VAL EMNAME><VAL>
^^^^
I went to<VAL SPOT> and took down a few of them. <VAL><VAL EMNAME>; Well, remember, you can expect more next time.
^^^^
Dear Master-- I went to [<VAL SPOT>] to search and managed to kill<VAL><VAL EMNAME>-- I think I pushed myself a little too hard.
^^^^
Dear Master, I went to explore of 《<VAL SPOT>》 and got so-so results and here are the treasures I found during my exploration!
^^^^
I'm back from exploring<VAL SPOT> I brought back some souvenirs for you Well, don't expect too much, but please accept them!
^^^^
While searching for<VAL SPOT> I found some treasure and brought it back home It was a bit risky, but-- Well, I hope it turned out well.
^^^^
And there seems to be an anomaly in the 《<VAL SPOT>》 clan members should explore it How about it?
^^^^
Master, please don't forget to receive your expedition results. -- oops, I don't need to tell you that.
^^^^
Yo, Lord Arisen, I am relieved to see that you are well today.
^^^^
Cherish your life today, my Master. -- Remember, the Master is all that matters to the pawns.
^^^^
--Do I look nervous? I'm a bit confident in my fighting skills... but social occasions like this are not something I'm used to.
^^^^
I get so excited when I see a protruding thing like that. Is it because I'm having too many adventures? It's such a big place-- there should be a hidden room or two!
^^^^
Lord, you need to purchase "Pawn Expedition" from clan store to explore that spot.
^^^^
My Lord--the Pawn is still crafting and cannot participate in the Pawn Expedition.
^^^^
I would like to be informed of today's search destination
^^^^
Lord, I've already dispatched a spot search today. I can't join the search.
^^^^
Then we're off.
^^^^
You require <VAL> free slots in your possession-- I can't give you the results of the expedition at this time.
^^^^
We went to<VAL SPOT>to search for <VAL><VAL EMNAME>. The subjugation was successful...
^^^^
I went to<VAL SPOT>to search for and killed<VAL><VAL EMNAME> that were living there-- injuries were minor.
^^^^
We have just returned from searching <VAL SPOT>  for<VAL EMNAME>and have successfully taken down <VAL>enemies--any other orders?
^^^^
My Master- Explored <VAL SPOT>, found and obtained the treasure --please accept it.
^^^^
《<VAL SPOT>》 search mission completed. Obtained treasure as a result of exploration.
^^^^
My Lord, 《<VAL SPOT>》's search mission is completed and the treasure is obtained -- minor wear and tear, but no problems in carrying out the mission.
^^^^
--My Lord, I have more to report.  There is an anomaly in《<VAL SPOT>》 I recommend a joint search with clan members.
^^^^
Be careful not to forget to take the expedition results!
^^^^
--Can I help you?
^^^^
A smooth mission completion today as well!
^^^^
--I will do my best to be as powerful as my Arisen comrade
^^^^
Uneven walls, enigmatic beams-- The existence of undiscovered rooms is undeniable --Lord, I encourage you to continue your search!
^^^^
Oh, Master, you can purchase "Pawn Expedition" from the Clan Shop to explore the spot!
^^^^
Sorry, Master-- Pawns that are crafting can't join the search as a pawn expedition.
^^^^
Where should we go exploring today, Master?
^^^^
Oh... I'm sorry, Master. I've already been sent out to explore today. I can't participate.
^^^^
I'll be off then, Master
^^^^
Master, I'd like to give you the results of the expedition-- Could you please make<VAL> spots available on hand?
^^^^
I went exploring to<VAL SPOT> where I took down<VAL><VAL EMNAME> and such-- I did my best to please you.
^^^^
I'm back from the search at<VAL SPOT> It was a close call, but I subjugated<VAL><VAL EMNAME> I'd better not be too reckless from now on--
^^^^
I've been exploring<VAL SPOT> and took down<VAL><VAL EMNAME>. as you ordered me to do-- I hope you haven't noticed any changes while I've been gone.
^^^^
I went exploring to<VAL SPOT> I found a nice treasure-- I thought the master would be pleased, so I brought it back Hey, what do you think?
^^^^
Master, as you ordered, I went to to search for<VAL SPOT> I found something nice, so I brought it back Hmm, I'm glad you like it.
^^^^
Master, I went to to search for 《<VAL SPOT>》 -- I was in danger. But you see, I have a souvenir of a treasure.
^^^^
Oh, and there are some strange things happening at<VAL SPOT>. How about we go and search for with the clan members?
^^^^
Hey Master, did you forget to get the results of the expedition?
^^^^
Yes, yes, what's wrong? You want something from me, don't you?
^^^^
Be careful not to get hurt today, Master.
^^^^
Ummm... When Arisen people gather together in such a wonderful place, Don't you think you'll forget about your Pawn?
^^^^
It's so big, I wouldn't be surprised if there are hidden rooms -- It's good to walk in unusual places, but don't slip and hurt yourself
^^^^

^^^^
We went to<VAL SPOT>to search for dangerous monsters. We encountered <VAL EMNAME>and succeeded in defeating<VAL> of them, Master.
^^^^
We went to<VAL SPOT>to search for<VAL EMNAME> and as you ordered, we completed the subjugation of <VAL> I hope the results meet your expectations...
^^^^
Dear Arisen! I went to 《<VAL SPOT>》 to explore and brought back the treasure I found!
^^^^
Dear Arisen!　As you ordered, I went to 《<VAL SPOT>》 to search and found more treasures, which I brought back!
^^^^
Dear Master, We found the treasure in our search for 《<VAL SPOT>》 It was a close call, but we managed to bring it back!
^^^^
Dear Master, I have a further report-- It seems that there is an anomaly in 《<VAL SPOT>》 Let's search for it with all the clan members!
^^^^
Dear Arisen! Please be careful not to forget to pick up your rewards!
^^^^
Yes, Master. I am at your service.
^^^^
Take care of yourself today, Master.
^^^^
Yes, Arisen Leave it to us pawns to look after the clan base!
^^^^
What a spacious base! You can enter by unexpected means and routes-- There may be such hidden rooms, etc!
^^^^
Master! If you buy a "Pawn Expedition" from the clan store you will be able to explore the spot Come on, let's go buy it!
^^^^
Master, a pawn in crafting cannot participate in exploration! Ahh-- I would be more helpful if I could do both crafting and dispatching at the same time!
^^^^
Master, where shall we go exploring today? In the mountains or in the valley, leave it to me!
^^^^
Master, I am unable to participate in the search today as I have already been dispatched explore-- I look forward to tomorrow's search!
^^^^
Master, I will be off then!
^^^^
Master, I am sorry! We cannot give you expedition results unless you have <VAL> slots available on hand!
^^^^
Master! I went to<VAL SPOT>to explore-- And lo and behold!<VAL EMNAME>, <VAL> defeated!
^^^^
I went to 《<VAL SPOT>》 to search for the <VAL><VAL EMNAME> and killed them, Master Next time - I'm sure you'll do better!
^^^^
I went to 《<VAL SPOT>》 to search for the <VAL><VAL EMNAME> I have defeated them! I think I got a pretty good feel for the situation!
^^^^
《<VAL SPOT>》 The search is complete! We have found a treasure and of course we have brought it back! This must be a wonderful item!
^^^^
I went to search for<VAL SPOT>and to my surprise-- I found a treasure! I brought it back with me, so please give it to me!
^^^^
<VAL SPOT> I went to search for and found the treasure, so I managed to bring it back -- well, I had nine lives!
^^^^
Then, there was an anomaly in 《<VAL SPOT>》 Come on Master, let's get all clan members to search for it!
^^^^
Master! Please be careful not to forget to take the results of your expedition!
^^^^
Yes, Master! Now, what kind of guy shall we kill today?
^^^^
Master, today is another good day for training!
^^^^
Master, training will not betray you! To avoid regrets when the time comes-- Let's work together!
^^^^
This base is - spacious, mysterious and exciting, Master! It's a building with lots of beams and bumps, perfect for moving around. How about you join us in our search for a hidden room?
^^^^
Hello, Arisen If there is anything I can do for you, please let me know.
^^^^
Yes, Master Have a good day, and take care of yourself today!
^^^^
Dear Arisen-- Is it still preferable to have Arisen helping each other rather than having a pawn accompany you on your adventures?
^^^^
To hire a pawn, please visit us at a Riftstone! We are looking forward to hearing from you!
^^^^
The liveliness of the clan base is a different good thing from the Masters private room!
^^^^
Oh, Master, if there is anything you need, please don't hesitate to ask.
^^^^
Seeing the Master off on an adventure is the most unsettling thing for a pawn.
^^^^
My Arisen Between you and me, I'm worried about how well you're doing in the clan. Oh, keep this a secret!
^^^^
If you're going on an adventure, why don't you hire me? I'm sure I can help you!
^^^^
Well, this is such a great place-- I'm kind of embarrassed. Are you sure you're okay with me being here? I hope I'm not standing out too much?
^^^^
Yes, what is it? Don't be shy, and tell us anything you want.
^^^^
You're going on another adventure today, aren't you? Be careful not to get hurt.
^^^^
Hehe, hello Thank you very much for being my master today.
^^^^
Hi, what's up? Oh, I was wondering-- if you'd like to go on an adventure with me.
^^^^
There are so many nice people here-- I can't stop looking at them!
^^^^
Yes, yes - can I help you?
^^^^
Hey, hello Well, please take care and come here.
^^^^
Ah, with my Arisen... I hope we get along well today as well.
^^^^
But, if you could choose me as a support pawn? -- I will do my best!
^^^^
--I wonder where he's gone, Lord Arisen. I can't wait to go back to my room--
^^^^
Hello! Hey, hey, let's go on an adventure!
^^^^
I don't want you to get injured, The Arisen and the pawn are the same... Please be careful when you go today!
^^^^
Me and my master, We look forward to your continued support!
^^^^
What is it? Maybe you want to go on an adventure with me? Well, you shouldn't follow people you don't know. --Oh my goodness!
^^^^
I wish I had a clan base like this! If only my master's room was as big as this.
^^^^
Yes, how can we help you? Are you looking for an adventure?　 A craft?
^^^^
Hello! Are you going on another adventure today? If so, please join me!
^^^^
Is our Master doing well in the clan? I look forward to working with you and your pawns!
^^^^
If you need a support pawn, I will be happy to help you! I'm sure you'll be very satisfied with the outcome. I will show you a result that will delight you!
^^^^
This place is very inspiring! Ahhh -- I can't wait to train!
^^^^
--What is it?
^^^^
All clear in clan base.
^^^^
How is my Lord-- -- needless worry, excuse me.
^^^^
If you're employed, you'll be accompanied-- It doesn't matter if you're another Arisen, it's still the same.
^^^^
--We are on the lookout for hostile individuals in the clan's stronghold.
^^^^
Oh, what is it? You saw me and couldn't help but say hello to me? I can understand why you would feel that way.
^^^^
Good day, Lord Arisen. Have a good trip today--
^^^^
Where is my master? How dare you leave me?
^^^^
There are so many different kinds of Arisen in this world. Each has its own color. Each beautiful in its own way.
^^^^
This majestic base is not bad-- but I also like the Lord's own room, which is cozy in its own small way!

Good day to you. The Honorable Master of the Learned.
^^^^
You may be the key to this adventure!
^^^^
It is a great pleasure to be with you.
^^^^
Oh, I have a feeling we are in for a great adventure!
^^^^
Let us see you with flowers for your success!
^^^^
Cheers to this encounter!
^^^^
Oh?　Looks like someone's here.
^^^^
Well, I guess that's to be expected.
^^^^
This accomplishment is wonderful!
^^^^
Your work is worthy of being passed down to the next generation.
^^^^
Too bad. Another time--
^^^^
Huh. You're getting strong again.
^^^^
I need you to tell me what my limits are!
^^^^
Ahh!　I want to show off my honed skills!
^^^^
Heh. Every heroic tale starts with a small step.
^^^^
Of course, I will accompany you wherever you go.
^^^^
Is the enemy here?
^^^^
Oops, there's something here.
^^^^
That's the shadow of the enemy - heh!
^^^^
I don't dislike it. The elation of facing a strong enemy - that's what it's all about!
^^^^
To run or to stand? It's a real toss-up.
^^^^
Thank you!
^^^^
Huh?! Oh, shit!
^^^^
Asking for... help...
^^^^
So much for - unwillingness to -!
^^^^
What I-- what I did--
^^^^
I don't want to see blood.
^^^^
Let's make light of it.
^^^^
It was quite a picturesque battle.
^^^^
Heh!　I'm glad I could help.
^^^^
A beautiful celebration of victory, to you and the dragon.
^^^^
Come on, this way. Now!
^^^^
I'm afraid I'm a little wounded.
^^^^
It's not that it's tough. It's still--
^^^^
Damn - the wounds on my body...!
^^^^
You don't have time to worry about being seen--
^^^^
We have to do something about this situation!
^^^^
Oh, no!　How did you--!
^^^^
Come on!　Take it.
^^^^
Now it's back to normal!
^^^^
Ah! It's my turn here!
^^^^
Let's make it easier to fight!
^^^^
I can't reach it!
^^^^
Phew!
^^^^
How about this!
^^^^
Dance!
^^^^
Let's let them fly high!
^^^^
I will comply
^^^^
Yes, I understand.
^^^^
Oops, I can't do that.
^^^^
Preparing for your next adventure?
^^^^
Oh, Arisen, are we departing?
^^^^
Arisen, please let me know if you need anything.
^^^^
The Master needs his rest, and so do I!
^^^^
I'm sure you must be tired, so please take a good rest.
^^^^
Sweet dreams, Master.
^^^^
It's also good to be particular about the living environment like this.
^^^^
Hmm, rearranging the room, great taste.
^^^^
Arisen, I have returned from exploring the area
^^^^
This time exploring the area - my talent is frightening!
^^^^
Well--very interesting indeed--and I'm sure you'll be able to find out more about it.
^^^^
Arisen, there are small guests in the garden.
^^^^
Impressive―my talent is terrifying, even in cooking!
^^^^
If this is the case, did you go out of your way to make this happen for me--?
^^^^
We will meet your expectations-- No, we promise to exceed them!
^^^^
With this skill, you can fight more vividly.
^^^^
I see, I should be very active with this skill.
^^^^
Rest is also a duty of a fighter.
^^^^
Is it my turn? Which stage today?
^^^^
Yes, how can I help you?
^^^^
What, are you asking about my beauty?
^^^^
All of my talents have always been for you.
^^^^
I recently demonstrated my talent as an assistant in Crafting
^^^^
I did a good job the other day on an adventure with another enlightened person.
^^^^
The other day, another Arisen praised this equipment, hehehe
^^^^
Arisen, today I will make a combat technique proposal
^^^^
Dear Arisen, my communication skills have improved thanks to my service to you!
^^^^
Dear Mr. Sensei, I have a hair style suggestion for you today!
^^^^
You have acquired a new family property! This is worthy of the honor of the Master of the Arisen!
^^^^
Your return will finally make me feel at home.
^^^^
Glad to see you back safe and sound!
^^^^
I've been eagerly waiting for your return!
^^^^
Thank you for your hard work. Would you like to take a short break?
^^^^
The moment you come back here is another thing to look forward to.
^^^^
Well, let's take a short break.
^^^^
This place is a veritable oasis.
^^^^
Have you checked the Quest Board? This is your chance to make a name for yourself.
^^^^
Oops, let me come over to you.
^^^^
Don't panic, please wait.
^^^^
Well, it's alright.
^^^^
Take care, Mr. Sensei.
^^^^
You are angry. It is unseemly.
^^^^
You are very excited, my dear sir.
^^^^
Oh, where's that swagger you had earlier?
^^^^
Are you down already? Now let's move on to the attack!
^^^^
It can't be helped, let's shake them up!
^^^^
Weaknesses, you think I can't see them?
^^^^
Can you stand to be hit on your weak points?
^^^^
Let me assist you, with this technique!
^^^^
Let's change the enemy's state, with this technique!
^^^^
Thank you for your patience. Attribution will be given!
^^^^
I hope you can hold out for this attack with power on board.
^^^^
Hahaha, take this technique and at least scatter beautifully!

^^^^
It's raining new specialties It's called inspiration.
^^^^
The special skills of a fellow hired hand, I've learned them too.
^^^^
Oh, Looks like there's a job training enemy around here.
^^^^
There's a training enemy right there.
^^^^
You've achieved the ordeal, I'll have to go report it to the jobmaster at 
^^^^
This feeling--a priceless treasure, no mistake on my reading 
^^^^
There will be rare treasures to be found in this vicinity, if you look for them.
^^^^
I'm sure you're feeling it too, Mr. Sensei. There's something going on around here.
^^^^
I smell it--may I suggest you check around a bit?
^^^^
See, there is a rare enemy.
^^^^
Well, well, well. You've been greeted by an unusual enemy.
^^^^
What's this?　I'll take care of it.
^^^^
My wise Lord, I would like to learn from you in tactical training.
^^^^
Well, well, well. I've heard rumors--
^^^^
We welcome those who are close to our Lord.
^^^^
Of course.
^^^^
I will do so.
^^^^
Let's get you back on your feet.
^^^^
Sweet, sweet, sweet--
^^^^
You think you're going to win?
^^^^
You don't seem to like fire.
^^^^
You don't seem to like ice.
^^^^
You don't seem to like thunder.
^^^^
You don't seem to like Holy.
^^^^
You don't seem to like darkness.
^^^^
Even on a spooky island, the brilliance of the squire remains the same
^^^^
Let's go find what you want, Arisen!
^^^^
Arisen, I have a special request today to make my abilities more complete
^^^^
Dear savant, please rejoice my power for you is now complete!
^^^^
Come on Master, let's go on an adventure My hands are full of power too!
^^^^
Working together to achieve our mission
^^^^
Thank you for your cooperation.
^^^^
Gathered Arisen, let us serve you with loyalty
^^^^
I see you as trustworthy.
^^^^
We will do our best to make the mission a success.
^^^^
Let's do our utmost for good cooperation.
^^^^
My Lord, confirming the presence of a peer.
^^^^
Mission Completed
^^^^
Almost exactly as calculated.
^^^^
This success is inevitable.
^^^^
--this is an unexpected result.
^^^^
Basic Abilities, Increased
^^^^
Acquired a higher level of combat power!
^^^^
All this power, all this power for my Lord.
^^^^
First, check the surrounding conditions.
^^^^
Be sure not to neglect securing the return route
^^^^
Enemy shadow recognized. Go to alert.
^^^^
Capture the target for extermination
^^^^
Enemy spotted!　Stay alert!
^^^^
Threatening enemy detected. Be careful!
^^^^
Judged to be a strong enemy--maximum caution!
^^^^
Appreciate the support.
^^^^
Support Request!
^^^^
Help! It's bad!
^^^^
The... front line... withdrawal...
^^^^
Arisen! Inaction――Inability to――
^^^^
Enemy elimination, begin!
^^^^
Shifted to battle stance!
^^^^
Target silenced. Decent results.
^^^^
Complete threat elimination
^^^^
The battle is over!　We win.
^^^^
Successfully stopped the target!
^^^^
Injured, but no problems.
^^^^
Status attention. Take action as soon as possible
^^^^
Injury site, expanding――!
^^^^
It would be difficult to continue the mission under these circumstances--
^^^^
Quick, we need to regroup immediately――
^^^^
What?　All of our strategies have been in vain.
^^^^
Just-- just a moment-- just a moment.
^^^^
Recover immediately!
^^^^
I'm going to guide the enemy.
^^^^
Cover!
^^^^
Avoid!
^^^^
There!
^^^^
A must!
^^^^
We will make sure to finish them off!
^^^^
Take the leap from here!
^^^^
Understood.
^^^^
follow orders
^^^^
find it hard to accept
^^^^
Check your equipment and tools very carefully.
^^^^
My Lord, I see that the time for your departure is near.
^^^^
Take a moderate break before fatigue sets in.
^^^^
Rest is also essential for mental and physical stability
^^^^
Sleep well, my Lord.
^^^^
Lord, I'll wait here while you rest.
^^^^
Indoor scenery changes
^^^^
The strangeness of redecorating--a realization
^^^^
Lord, I'm back from exploring the area.
^^^^
Excellent results in this area search!
^^^^
I read books for the Lord.
^^^^
Lord, I sense a presence in the garden.
^^^^
Nutritionally perfect--
^^^^
I promise I will do my best.
^^^^
I will surely protect you Lord.
^^^^
This warfare technique should help you.
^^^^
Tactics have changed
^^^^
If there is anything I can do to help you during this time of rest, please let me know.
^^^^
Let us prepare for our Lord's next purpose.
^^^^
Lord, what is your purpose today?
^^^^
Answering the Call.
^^^^
All for the Lord's sake.
^^^^
I recently carried out craft assistance at the request of a different memorandum of understanding and received an evaluation
^^^^
In the past, at the request of different enlightened persons, I accompanied them on their journey and received thanks
^^^^
I recently received a good evaluation of my equipment from a different enlightened person
^^^^
My Lord, today I propose a war technique.
^^^^
My days of following the Lord have improved my communication skills.
^^^^
My Lord, today I have a hair style proposal for you.
^^^^
Confirmation that new household goods are available-- Improved livability.
^^^^
My Lord's return, we have been waiting for you.
^^^^
Confirmation that the Lord is safe.
^^^^
Lord, I have been away for a long time, and I have been anxious--
^^^^
This concludes this escort.
^^^^
Returned home safely after a long trip.
^^^^
Arrived at the base and released combat readiness.
^^^^
Interaction with local residents is also sometimes beneficial--and
^^^^
Check area information and equipment before departure.
^^^^
Get over here right now--
^^^^
Prioritize rescuing the master
^^^^
Crisis, rescuing the Master
^^^^
Not a serious matter
^^^^
Check for excitement, be alert--.
^^^^
There is a high possibility of making dangerous movements due to agitation.
^^^^
Confirm the enemy's opening - now is the perfect opportunity
^^^^
Enemy movement halted, commence all-out attack
^^^^
Shake them up, fatigue them.
^^^^
Exposing weaknesses, leave it to me—
^^^^
Target weak points and move efficiently
^^^^
Release techniques that support the master
^^^^
For the Lord's sake, aim to reduce the enemy's ability
^^^^
Increasing attributes!
^^^^
Gather power, add force, and shoot the enemy.
^^^^
Silence the target with your most powerful technique.

The enemy's weak point is lightning

The enemy's weak point is darkness.

Where are we going? I'm looking forward to it.
^^^^
What's in store today?
^^^^
Ah!　Look, it's the enemy!
^^^^
Arisen, the enemy is over there!
^^^^
There's something in there-- we have to be careful--
^^^^
Wow!　That looks so strong!
^^^^
Oh, Arisen, are you going to fight with that thing?
^^^^
Thank you!
^^^^
Help, someone!!
^^^^
Do something about this guy!
^^^^
I'm sorry, I'm already...
^^^^
Ugh... I've been hit...
^^^^
Okay, I'll take care of it!
^^^^
Ah, the enemy is here!
^^^^
It was an easy win!
^^^^
It wasn't as strong as I thought it would be.
^^^^
Arisen, I'm glad you're safe, my lord!
^^^^
Now!　Voila!
^^^^
Don't worry!　This much.
^^^^
--I've been hit a little bit.
^^^^
Ouch--but I'm trying--I'm trying--I'm trying.
^^^^
Oh, Arisen, I'm already out of energy...
^^^^
Oh, no--I'm gonna collapse--
^^^^
Eh!? Arisen, Arisen!!
^^^^
All right, here we go!
^^^^
Ah!　I'll fix it right away!
^^^^
Hey!　I'm over here!
^^^^
I will assist you!
^^^^
It won't hit!
^^^^
That's it!
^^^^
Eiyaa! Take that!
^^^^
This is going to hurt!
^^^^
This way, come on, jump!
^^^^
Yes, I understand!
^^^^
Got it!
^^^^
What?!　I can't do it for a minute!
^^^^
Arisen, what are you doing?
^^^^
Oh, are you ready to go out already?
^^^^
If you're tired, let's take a rest, Lord Arisen?
^^^^
Please take your time, Arisen
^^^^
Good night. Here's a spell that will help you have good dreams--
^^^^
Sleep well and let's go on another adventure!
^^^^
Wow! I love this furniture too.
^^^^
Redecorating is kind of fun!
^^^^
Arisen, I have returned from exploring the area
^^^^
We achieved very good results in this area exploration!
^^^^
Oh, wow-- hmmm--
^^^^
There's something in the garden! Hehe, how cute~!
^^^^
Like this?　I think I may have put too much in.
^^^^
Yay!　I wanted something like this!
^^^^
With this, we will protect the Arisen perfectly, you know!
^^^^
Alright, I'm going to work hard with these skills!
^^^^
I guess I'll have to get the hang of this skill!
^^^^
Hey, Master Arisen, let's take it easy once in a while!
^^^^
Hmm? Are you going somewhere?
^^^^
What is it, Lord Arisen?
^^^^
Hey, hey, where are we going today?
^^^^
I will assist the Arisen!
^^^^
I was praised as a crafting assistant for another Arisen the other day!
^^^^
Yes, I accompanied Arisen the other day. I did my best!
^^^^
Oh, by the way, I got complimented on this outfit by another Arisen!　Heh heh.
^^^^
Dear savant, today I am going to propose a war technique!
^^^^
Thanks to the Arisen who let me accompany him I have improved my communication skills!
^^^^
I have a hair style suggestion for you today!
^^^^
So you got a new family property! That's great, amazing!　It's going to be comfortable!
^^^^
Arisen, welcome back
^^^^
I really wish I could protect the Arisen.
^^^^
I was so worried when you didn't come back.
^^^^
Mission to safely escort the Arisen has been completed!
^^^^
I enjoyed this trip as well!
^^^^
Arisen, let's take a break if you're tired
^^^^
I love exploring the characteristics of each base!
^^^^
Let's replenish the supplies and take a break!
^^^^
Ah, Arisen!　I'm coming!
^^^^
Wow, wait a minute!
^^^^
There we go!
^^^^
See, it's all right now!
^^^^
Wow, he's angry!　I have to be careful!
^^^^
I've pissed them off--I have to fight well!
^^^^
Looks tired! It's an opportunity to attack!
^^^^
Okay, it's down! Let's attack together!
^^^^
I'm going to shake things up!
^^^^
As long as we can find a weakness, we're all set!
^^^^
I'll attack the weak point! This must be the spot it hates!
^^^^
Lord Arisen, I will support you with this war technique!
^^^^
What a troublesome guy! How about this abnormal state?!
^^^^
Arisen, I will bestow upon you a new attribute!
^^^^
I will gather power and attack! Leave it to me!
^^^^
I can do it, too! With this big move -- here I go!

^^^^
Dear Arisen!　I've got a new trick up my sleeve!
^^^^
The special skill of the pawn Master hired-- I learned it too!
^^^^
There seems to be a job training enemy around here.
^^^^
Ah, Master Arisen!　 There's your training enemy right there!
^^^^
Dear Arisen, you have achieved your job training!　 Yay!
^^^^
I'm sure there's a treasure chest of glitter around here somewhere.
^^^^
Arisen, would you like to try treasure hunting around here?
^^^^
Arisen, there's something around here!
^^^^
Hmmm... something is fishy about this place...
^^^^
Ah, this guy is a rare one!
^^^^
Hey Arisen! This is a rare enemy!
^^^^
I found something good!
^^^^
I would like to learn more about you, , in tactical training!
^^^^
You are good friends with my mentor, aren't you?
^^^^
Your friend, Mr. Sentient-- I'm glad you came!
^^^^
Yes, I will!
^^^^
I'm on it!
^^^^
I will recover!
^^^^
You can avoid that much!
^^^^
And then...!
^^^^
The flames are going to work!
^^^^
The ice is going to help!
^^^^
Lightning is going to work!
^^^^
I think the holy will work!
^^^^
The darkness is going to work!
^^^^
Let's find something good and go home!
^^^^
What a strange island!
^^^^
Dear Learner, I want to help you more and more. So I have one request!
^^^^
Thank you very much, Mr. Awakened! We'll help you with the power we've got!
^^^^
Won't you go on an adventure with me, Master? I'll be most useful to you!
^^^^
Lovely person. It's an honor to meet you.
^^^^
I'll do my best to make it a good trip.
^^^^
You can tell me anything if you like.
^^^^
Leave the support to us. Phew!
^^^^
I'll try to make sure you like it.
^^^^
I look forward to working with you, Master.
^^^^
Oh, my. Master, I think he's here.
^^^^
That's my master!
^^^^
Hmmm!　That was a nice accomplishment.
^^^^
These results, you're good.
^^^^
These things happen. Don't let it get you down.
^^^^
Phew, I hope that's a little better.
^^^^
It's all coming together!
^^^^
Please keep them by your side forever.
^^^^
Have you forgotten anything?　Tools, equipment...
^^^^
Well, let's go, Master.
^^^^
Oh, my God, it's the enemy.
^^^^
Watch out. There's a sign of the enemy.
^^^^
There's something here. It's close.
^^^^
Master, are you going to deal with that?
^^^^
Are you sure you're up for this?　You look pretty tough.
^^^^
Hmm, thanks!
^^^^
Aah, help!
^^^^
Damn, I was caught off guard--!
^^^^
Oh, this isn't-- this isn't how it's supposed to be.
^^^^
Ugh!　I'm sorry, Master!
^^^^
Okay, here we go.
^^^^
Let's get into it!
^^^^
Please give me more satisfaction.
^^^^
Hmmm, that was pretty good.
^^^^
I will not allow anyone to turn on the Master.
^^^^
Now, please! While I have it under control!
^^^^
It's nothing, really
^^^^
This is not good--we have to do something.
^^^^
It's getting a little spicy--
^^^^
Ugh!　I can't go down now--
^^^^
Somehow - I have to endure - I have to endure!
^^^^
Hey, hey!　　No, Master!
^^^^
Here we go!
^^^^
Don't worry, I'll heal you in no time.
^^^^
You there!　Look at me!
^^^^
Leave the support to us!
^^^^
Don't do it!
^^^^
How about this?
^^^^
Ha!　Fall!
^^^^
Persistent!!
^^^^
Jump on me! Quickly!!
^^^^
Understood!
^^^^
At your command
^^^^
What!? Even if you suddenly say that--
^^^^
Oh, are you organizing your belongings?
^^^^
If we're checking our gear, does that mean we're about to leave?
^^^^
I think it's time for you to take a break, Master.
^^^^
Hey, it's nice to spend some time here.
^^^^
Good night, Master.
^^^^
Rest well for your next adventure!
^^^^
It's like the atmosphere of the room has changed somehow!
^^^^
As expected of you, Master. Your sense is excellent.
^^^^
Master, I'm back from exploring the area.
^^^^
We've had very good results exploring the area this time!
^^^^
Hmmm--I see what you mean.
^^^^
Look!　There's something in the garden!
^^^^
Hmm, it smells good, even if I say so myself.
^^^^
Do I look good in my new gear?
^^^^
We've got to work to match this equipment.
^^^^
I'm looking forward to trying this skill.
^^^^
I will show you a different kind of work, Master.
^^^^
Wouldn't it be nice to live here all the time?　Master--
^^^^
Hmm? Where are we going today?
^^^^
What's wrong?　Master--
^^^^
I'm here, hehe
^^^^
I'm so happy to be by your side.
^^^^
I helped another Arisen with a craft the other day I made a good one myself!
^^^^
I recently assisted another Arisen lady with her adventure What do you think? I've been working hard!
^^^^
Another Arisen looked at me and complimented me on my sense of style!
^^^^
Master, I have a proposal for combat techniques today.
^^^^
Master, serving you has improved my communication skills!
^^^^
Master, today I would like to make a hairstyle suggestion!
^^^^
You've got a new family property It's going to be a great room--
^^^^
Welcome back, Master.
^^^^
Master, I'm so glad you're okay.
^^^^
Oh, Master!　You're back!
^^^^
Thank you for your hard work, Master.
^^^^
It's kind of relaxing to be back in your room.
^^^^
The journey is long. Let's take a break.
^^^^
Let's take it easy here.
^^^^
Master, can we check on the tools and requests?
^^^^
Hold on! I'm going right now!
^^^^
Oh no, it's dangerous. Please wait for me.
^^^^
It's okay, Master.
^^^^
I'm here for you!
^^^^
Hmmm, you're getting riled up!
^^^^
Be careful, it seems like the enemy is getting excited!
^^^^
Look, it's tired, here's your chance!
^^^^
It's down! Let's go all out!
^^^^
I'm going to go shake things up!
^^^^
There is a weakness... right there!
^^^^
If you hit the weak spots, they wouldn't be able to stand!
^^^^
Let's counterattack, I'll support you with this technique!
^^^^
Lowering the enemy's ability!
^^^^
I'll improve your attributes! Let's go on the offensive!
^^^^
Don't underestimate this attack that I've built up power for.
^^^^
Now, I'll give you a special technique
^^^^
<COL B6FF01>《Special Skill》I will show you the power beyond your limits!</COL>
^^^^
<COL B6FF01>《Special Skill》I'll show you what I can do.</COL>
^^^^
<COL B6FF01>《Special Skill》Hehe, it seems like there's not enough excitement――</COL>
^^^^
<COL B6FF01>《Harden》This attack, I will carve it into your body!</COL>
^^^^
<COL B6FF01>《Harden》I'll go harder than usual!</COL>

<COL B6FF01>《Weaken》What kind of condition would be suitable for this enemy?</COL>
^^^^
<COL B6FF01>《Weaken》I wonder who I should start weakening.</COL>
^^^^
<COL B6FF01>《Concentration》This heightened magical power--I'll show you right away!</COL>
^^^^
<COL B6FF01>《Concentration》I think I can chant easily now.</COL>
^^^^
<COL B6FF01>《Fearless》No one can stop me now!</COL>
^^^^
<COL B6FF01>《Fearless》I guess I won't have to avoid them anymore.</COL>
^^^^
<COL B6FF01>《Attraction》I'll be in front of you!　Watch me, Master!</COL>
^^^^
<COL B6FF01>I'm going to make you stand out a little bit.</COL>
^^^^
<COL B6FF01>《Protection》I'm going to boost your defenses, so you can all go on the offensive.</COL>
^^^^
<COL B6FF01>《Protection》There is no pain with this</COL>
^^^^
<COL B6FF01>《Resurrection》 I won't forgive you for collapsing now!</COL>
^^^^
Hmmm!　 I've just come up with a new skill!
^^^^
The pawn specials you hired me for I learned them too!
^^^^
Hey, there seems to be a job training enemy around here.
^^^^
There's your training enemy right there!
^^^^
You've accomplished the ordeal!　Congratulations, Master!
^^^^
I have a feeling there's some precious treasure in there, why don't we look for it?
^^^^
Master, there may be some rare treasures around here.
^^^^
I think there's something around here.
^^^^
Master-- Would you like to explore this area a little?
^^^^
Oh, it's not that rare an enemy!　 Perhaps there's a chance for you.
^^^^
Haha―― An unexpected encounter, huh
^^^^
Oh, what's this?
^^^^
Hey?　I think it's time-- to do some tactical training.
^^^^
Ummm... I've been listening to your stories very carefully.
^^^^
Please take care of me too.
^^^^
Haha, understood
^^^^
I'll take care of it.
^^^^
Calm down, everything's fine now
^^^^
Hmm, such an attack!
^^^^
I won't let you get away with this!
^^^^
His weakness is fire.
^^^^
His weakness is ice.
^^^^
His weakness is lightning.
^^^^
The weak point is holy--
^^^^
His weakness is darkness.
^^^^
Good luck finding a bargain.
^^^^
No matter what happens, I'll stay by your side, Master.
^^^^
Hey--could you do me a favor? I want to be of more help to the master.
^^^^
Master, with this new power I will serve you even better than before. Stay tuned!
^^^^
Invite me if you're going on an adventure I'll help you everywhere, Master.
^^^^
Oh!　Thank you very much, Arisen!
^^^^
Hi. Don't hesitate to tell me anything.
^^^^
My power will surely be of use to you.
^^^^
I'm willing to go to any battlefield.
^^^^
I'm ready. Shall we go?
^^^^
We will take good care of you, don't worry.
^^^^
Oh, this feeling. Has that person arrived?
^^^^
Ha! Somehow, it went well, didn't it?
^^^^
I think it went well, but...
^^^^
This is quite an achievement, I must say!
^^^^
Oh, I'm so bad at this. Oh, shit.
^^^^
Oh?　That's not bad.
^^^^
Wow!　I'm filled with power!
^^^^
Heh!　Next battle, you can look forward to!
^^^^
So, where shall we go from here?
^^^^
Well, if something happens, we'll think about it then.
^^^^
It's the target
^^^^
Are they the enemy? Will you fight?
^^^^
Enemies?　It can't be helped--
^^^^
If you underestimate me, you're in for a world of hurt. Well then...
^^^^
Tsk!　He looks like trouble.
^^^^
I'm sorry!
^^^^
Somebody give me a hand here!
^^^^
Kuh!　Get off me, you son of a bitch!
^^^^
Hey, it's just a joke, you know
^^^^
What- What's happening!?
^^^^
You came!
^^^^
Well, shall I do it?
^^^^
Were you injured?
^^^^
Well, I guess I got my exercise instead.
^^^^
Don't get in the way of the Master of the Arisen!
^^^^
Okay, I got you!
^^^^
Oh, it's nothing serious.
^^^^
It's not going to be an easy win.
^^^^
I'm going to brace myself.
^^^^
This is a tough one...
^^^^
I cannot guarantee any more than this, it's impossible
^^^^
Hey!　No way, Lord Arisen!
^^^^
I'm gonna make you pay for this...
^^^^
Oh, recovery!
^^^^
Where are you looking, I'm your opponent!!
^^^^
Okay, I'll cover for you!
^^^^
That's not safe!
^^^^
Oh, ugh!
^^^^
Take it!
^^^^
There you go. How about this one!
^^^^
This way, I'll launch!
^^^^
Got it!
^^^^
Oh, got it!
^^^^
That's impossible.
^^^^
Oh, are you organizing your luggage?
^^^^
Are we about to leave?　You can call me anytime.
^^^^
It's better to take a little rest, ya know
^^^^
Hey, even if you slow down a little bit... The enemy won't run away.
^^^^
Oops, heh--I'll be quiet--I'll be quiet.
^^^^
Leave the night watch to me.
^^^^
The atmosphere has changed.
^^^^
Wow, it's nice to redecorate, isn't it?
^^^^
I just returned from exploring the area.
^^^^
Dear Arisen, this exploration of the area has been a great success!
^^^^
Hmm, huh? Hmm~
^^^^
Oh, Master Arisen!　There's something in the garden!
^^^^
Alright, this should be enough--
^^^^
I'm going to go on a rampage with this.
^^^^
I will protect you with all my energy!
^^^^
I can't wait to put these skills to use on the battlefield!
^^^^
Wow, this should make for some interesting battles.
^^^^
Fighting is good, but rest is also good.
^^^^
Let's see, where are we going today?
^^^^
Whoa, what is it?
^^^^
Master Arisen, What's wrong?
^^^^
We will protect you no matter what comes your way!
^^^^
I helped with crafts elsewhere the other day and it was appreciated!
^^^^
The other day, I was invited by another Arisen person to accompany him on a little adventure!
^^^^
By the way, I was praised by another Arisen for this equipment of mine!
^^^^
Arisen, may I propose a combat technique to you today?
^^^^
Thanks to following the Arisen My communication skills have improved!
^^^^
Dear Arisen, I have a haircut suggestion for you today!
^^^^
Dear Master, did you get new household goods? That's good!
^^^^
Oh, Master!　You are back!
^^^^
I am glad to hear that you are safe and sound, Arisen!
^^^^
I was worried because you didn't come back for a long time
^^^^
Phew, you made it back safely!
^^^^
It's nice to be at home, isn't it?
^^^^
The enemy can't get in here. Shall we take a break?
^^^^
Let's look at all the board quests and requests.
^^^^
Well, I'd better get ready for the next one.
^^^^
I'm on my way!
^^^^
Oh, Arisen! Please wait.
^^^^
Here we go!
^^^^
I'm with you!
^^^^
He's angry!　I gotta be careful!
^^^^
It looks agitated!　Be careful of the attacks!
^^^^
Mm, there's an opening!
^^^^
It's down! Let's go all out and do it!
^^^^
Can you withstand my shaking?!
^^^^
I see, now all weaknesses are exposed!
^^^^
Hitting the weak points is the basis of battle, you know!
^^^^
I'll support you with this technique!　Let's counterattack!
^^^^
Shall I lower his abilities?
^^^^
Improved attributes! Please try attacking now!
^^^^
I'll strike you with all my might!
^^^^
I never thought I'd see the time to use this technique!　Brace yourself!
^^^^
<COL B6FF01>《Special Skill》I'm going to push the limits of what's possible!</COL>
^^^^
<COL B6FF01>《Special Skill》 Hey -- it's time to go all out!</COL>
^^^^
<COL B6FF01>《Special Skill》I'll do it. I'll take care of it!</COL>
^^^^
<COL B6FF01>《Harden》This the power of the whole body!</COL>
^^^^
<COL B6FF01>《Harden》Bust them down with all your might!</COL>

<COL B6FF01>《Heavy》It would be easier to just fall down!</COL>
^^^^
<COL B6FF01>《Heavy》I'm going to blast the crap out of anyone who's getting on my nerves!</COL>
^^^^
<COL B6FF01>《Restoration》Let's restore it――with the blessing of healing!</COL>
^^^^
<COL B6FF01>《Restoration》: healing wounds and fatigue with determination!</COL>
^^^^
<COL B6FF01>Shall we 《Weaken》 them from the beginning?</COL>
^^^^
<COL B6FF01>If you 《Weaken》 the ability, it's not scary, right?</COL>
^^^^
<COL B6FF01>《Concentration》: I'll put all the magic I've got into it!</COL>
^^^^
<COL B6FF01>《Concentration》Now, let's concentrate.</COL>
^^^^
<COL B6FF01>《Fearless》I'll endure all your attacks!</COL>
^^^^
<COL B6FF01>《Fearless》―― Ignore such boring attacks</COL>
^^^^
<COL B6FF01>《Attraction》All of you are my prey!</COL>
^^^^
<COL B6FF01>《Attraction》Let the dying ones come to me.</COL>
^^^^
<COL B6FF01>《Protection》Arisen, you can be reckless for a while.</COL>
^^^^
<COL B6FF01>《Protection》 solidly covers our own defense</COL>
^^^^
<COL B6FF01>《Resurrection》, I will save the lives of the Arisen!</COL>
^^^^
Dear Arisen, I've got an idea for a new skill.
^^^^
Ah, I've learned the special skill of a hired pawn -!
^^^^
The job training enemy is not fond of this area.
^^^^
Lord Arisen, there are training enemies!
^^^^
Hmm? Have you finished your training?
^^^^
I have a feeling that there is a valuable treasure nearby.
^^^^
Dear Arisen,  Let's try searching for treasures around here.
^^^^
Just a moment please... Is there something around here?
^^^^
I wonder if there's something around here.
^^^^
This guy is a rarity. Thankfully, we can beat him up.
^^^^
Wow, that's an enemy you don't see very often.
^^^^
What is this? Should I take it?
^^^^
How about some tactical training soon?
^^^^
It's like my mentor is taking care of me.
^^^^
Since you're here, please take your time!
^^^^
Leave it to me.
^^^^
If the Arisen says so
^^^^
This guy can fix it!
^^^^
Oops!
^^^^
Missed.
^^^^
This guy is weak against fire!
^^^^
This guy is weak against ice!
^^^^
This guy is weak against lightning!
^^^^
This guy is weak to holy attacks!
^^^^
This one is weak against darkness!
^^^^
Well, let's see what we can come up with.
^^^^
It's not an easy place to get around.
^^^^
Hey, Master, in recognition of me, I wonder if you could do me a favor... No, it's not a bad idea.
^^^^
Arisen, with the power I have obtained,  I should be able to be of more help than before――  Please entrust it to me.
^^^^
You ready to get out of here? I'll take good care of you.
^^^^
Let's aim for it!　Together we will win!
^^^^
You are the best partner, Master!
^^^^
How reassuring!　I don't feel like losing!
^^^^
I am proud to be able to go with you!
^^^^
Oh! I am grateful for this encounter!
^^^^
Let us embark on a journey of trials!
^^^^
Oh!　Isn't that guy here?
^^^^
This is the result of passion and dedication!
^^^^
Alright! Let's keep it up for the next one!
^^^^
Glory be to our Master!
^^^^
Well... This failure will be my next stepping stone!
^^^^
It is the fruit of my efforts!
^^^^
My power is never ending!
^^^^
The power bestowed upon me, I shall exert it to the fullest with unwavering resolve!
^^^^
I wonder what adventures are in store for you, Master!
^^^^
Nothing can stop us!
^^^^
There it is!
^^^^
Enemy detected, be prepared!
^^^^
I will not let you interfere with my master!
^^^^
This is it! No shortage of opponents!
^^^^
What? There is always a chance to win!
^^^^
I am ashamed!
^^^^
――Help, rescue me!
^^^^
Please lend me a hand!
^^^^
I'm sorry...
^^^^
Oh, shoot.
^^^^
Preemptive action!
^^^^
Let's kick ass!
^^^^
Mm, it was a good fight!
^^^^
Ha ha!　We win!
^^^^
Our Master has no enemies!
^^^^
Master!! Now!
^^^^
These are only scratches!　There is still room for more!
^^^^
I'm not going to back down just because of this little injury!
^^^^
There is opportunity in crisis!
^^^^
Well, not yet!
^^^^
Woohoo, I'll hold on!
^^^^
Ma, mastaaaaaaaah!
^^^^
Haaaaaaah!
^^^^
All right!　Recovery!
^^^^
This way!　Cowards!
^^^^
I will help you as many times as you need!
^^^^
I won't let that happen!
^^^^
Here we go!
^^^^
Take it!
^^^^
With all my might!
^^^^
Use me as a springboard!
^^^^
We'll take care of it!
^^^^
Roger that!
^^^^
Oops! I, I can't do it!
^^^^
Oh, are you preparing for an adventure?
^^^^
When is your departure? Please let me accompany you!
^^^^
Master? Are you tired, by any chance?
^^^^
It is also important to get rid of fatigue!
^^^^
You are going to have a good night's rest, Master! Sweet dreams!
^^^^
Get energized for your next adventure!
^^^^
Oh, the atmosphere of the room has changed!
^^^^
Rearranging the room can be refreshing, isn't it?
^^^^
Arisen, I have returned from exploring the area
^^^^
I am confident in the results of this area exploration!
^^^^
Ho-hum-hum-hum--I see.
^^^^
Master!　There seems to be something in the garden!
^^^^
Haha, cooking is fun too!
^^^^
We will work even harder!
^^^^
Become the sword and shield of the Arisen with this equipment!!
^^^^
Oh, I can't wait to try this skill!
^^^^
Alright, we will show you a renewed battle!
^^^^
This kind of relaxing time is also good, Master!
^^^^
Wherever you are with us, we will be of service!
^^^^
Yes, Master!　I am here!
^^^^
What is it, Master?
^^^^
I will be with you forever and ever, wherever you go, Master!
^^^^
The other day, I assisted a fellow Arisen in their Crafting! Of course, I gave it my all!
^^^^
I was recently commended by another Arisen for my fighting spirit!
^^^^
I was praised for my equipment by another Arisen the other day!
^^^^
Master, I have a proposal for combat techniques today.
^^^^
Thanks to serving the Master, my communication skills have improved!
^^^^
Master, today I have a hairstyle suggestion for you!
^^^^
I see that you have acquired new household goods! It will make your room even more comfortable!
^^^^
Welcome back, Master!
^^^^
Glad to see you back in one piece, Master!
^^^^
I am so glad you are back!　We believed that we would definitely see you again!
^^^^
It was an honor to accompany you on this trip as well!
^^^^
It is nice to have a home to go back to!
^^^^
We can finally take a break. Are you hurt, Master?
^^^^
Base! It's safe here!
^^^^
Check your tools and equipment!
^^^^
Master! I'll assist you right now!
^^^^
Are you okay? Over there now!
^^^^
What's going on? Hold tight!
^^^^
Come on, let's go!
^^^^
Ah, so you're angry!
^^^^
The enemy seems to be excited! Please be careful!
^^^^
There is an opening!　There is no way to pass up this opportunity!
^^^^
It is down, attack with all your might!
^^^^
I'll shake you until you're exhausted!
^^^^
Weaknesses are uncovered!　--That's it!
^^^^
Target the weakness, that's the battle!
^^^^
Come on, let's go on the offensive!　Support!
^^^^
The vigor of the enemy, I will use this technique to reduce it!
^^^^
Increased attributes! Let's attack!
^^^^
I'll strike with all my might and soul!
^^^^
Burn this polished technique into your body!

^^^^
Master! I have come up with an amazing Special Skill!
^^^^
Arisen!　 Hired pawns Special Skill, I learned it too!
^^^^
Master, I sense a job training enemy around!
^^^^
Master, the training enemy is right there!
^^^^
You've done it, Master! You've completed the job training!
^^^^
There must be some precious treasures around here!
^^^^
There may be a rare treasure nearby, Master
^^^^
There seems to be something nearby, be sure to check it carefully!
^^^^
What?　 Around here - there must be something!
^^^^
This guy is a rare adversary, Master!
^^^^
This enemy must be defeated!　 It is not something you will encounter often!
^^^^
Item found!　I'll pick it up!
^^^^
Master, If you don't mind, I would appreciate tactical training!
^^^^
Oh, welcome!
^^^^
We have heard numerous tales of bravery!
^^^^
I see!
^^^^
So, let's get started!
^^^^
Now you can rest assured!
^^^^
I saw through it!
^^^^
Can you catch it?!
^^^^
Attack with fire!
^^^^
Attack with ice!
^^^^
Attack with lightning!
^^^^
Let's attack with holy power!
^^^^
Let's attack with darkness!
^^^^
I hope you have a good one!
^^^^
Now, explore the unknown island!
^^^^
Master!　I would like to make a request to you today, so that we can be of even greater service to you in the future.
^^^^
Oh--thank you, Master! With the power in my hands, I will be more useful to you than ever before!
^^^^
Master, let's go on an adventure now! I will surely be of help to you!
^^^^
Whether I can be of assistance or not――
^^^^
If possible, bring a companion...
^^^^
I'm so grateful that we can be together.
^^^^
If it's okay with someone like myself--
^^^^
I don't know if I can do it--
^^^^
May your journey be successful —
^^^^
Um... I think someone's here.
^^^^
We managed to do that, didn't we?
^^^^
Even I could do it!
^^^^
I was able to get lucky.
^^^^
It's depressing--
^^^^
I feel a little stronger.
^^^^
I did it!　I'm sure this will--
^^^^
I feel a little more confident.
^^^^
I'm nervous.
^^^^
How far will we go?
^^^^
Oh, there!
^^^^
The enemy is already close by.
^^^^
Be careful, it's an enemy.
^^^^
Oh, I can't believe I'm fighting that thing--
^^^^
That enemy.. may be.. uh-oh..
^^^^
Thank you very much for your help!
^^^^
Help me!!
^^^^
Oh no, s-someone is there!
^^^^
Oh--the power is draining out of me...
^^^^
I think I'm losing it.
^^^^
We have to go, right?
^^^^
it can't be helped
^^^^
I'm tired.
^^^^
Oh--I was so nervous!
^^^^
I am so glad you are safe.
^^^^
I stopped it! Now is the time!
^^^^
Nothing to worry about. Nothing to worry about.
^^^^
Ugh, I'm worried--
^^^^
If we don't do this--
^^^^
I'm already on edge--
^^^^
If you don't recover soon!
^^^^
Eh? - A-Arisen!?
^^^^
Wait, I'm almost--
^^^^
Here's a little more.
^^^^
I don't want to stand out, but here's the thing--
^^^^
But good luck!
^^^^
Caution!
^^^^
You!
^^^^
Enough is enough!
^^^^
Ah, geez!
^^^^
Quickly, now!
^^^^
Yeah--
^^^^
Roger that.
^^^^
What?　Oh, no, I can't--
^^^^
Are you getting ready for an adventure?
^^^^
Um, are you going out?　If you don't mind, I'll accompany you...
^^^^
If you're tired, you should get some rest.
^^^^
Lord Arisen can rest and be at ease
^^^^
Ah, good night, Lord Arisen
^^^^
Rest is important, too.
^^^^
It kind of changed the feel of the room.
^^^^
Redecorating is fun!
^^^^
Arisen, I have returned from exploring the area
^^^^
We achieved very good results in this area exploration!
^^^^
Um... Ah, I see...
^^^^
Arisen, something has appeared in the garden...
^^^^
I hope it turns out delicious...
^^^^
Wow, thank you very much! Um, I'll do my best--!
^^^^
We need to work to match this equipment.
^^^^
With these skills, I'm sure--
^^^^
I hope I can handle it well.
^^^^
Sometimes it's nice to relax like this.
^^^^
Oh, perhaps you are going out?
^^^^
Yes, what is it?
^^^^
Um, what's wrong?
^^^^
I want to be more helpful to Lord Arisen-- much more than that.
^^^^
The other day, I helped another Arisen with a craft I hope it went well--
^^^^
The other day, I accompanied another Arisen. I was nervous, but I tried my best.
^^^^
Well, the other day, another Arisen complimented me on this attire.
^^^^
Arisen, please allow me to propose a battle technique today!
^^^^
Thanks to the Arisen who I have served, I have improved my communication skills!
^^^^
Dear Arisen, I have a hair style suggestion for you today!
^^^^
Dear Arisen, I see that you have acquired new household goods! This is going to be comfortable--
^^^^
Arisen, welcome back
^^^^
Haha, I'm so relieved you're okay.
^^^^
I was worried because you didn't come back for a long time.
^^^^
It's good. I was able to safely take you home.
^^^^
I'm still relieved to be back in this room.
^^^^
Would you like to take a break, Master?
^^^^
Phew, I feel safe here.
^^^^
Let's check out the various requests and information.
^^^^
I, I'm going now!
^^^^
I'm fine, I'll be there in a second!
^^^^
Lord Arisen! Are you, are you alright?
^^^^
Don't give up just yet--!
^^^^
Oh, he seems angry!　Be careful!
^^^^
Excitement!　The enemy may be out of control!
^^^^
Oh, an opportunity has arisen with the enemy!
^^^^
It seems, it seems down! Let's go!
^^^^
I'm going to shake things up!
^^^^
Expose its weakness! Aim for it!
^^^^
Weaknesses--attack the core!
^^^^
We will support you, so you counterattack!
^^^^
Lowering the enemy's ability!
^^^^
Increased attributes! Let's attack!

^^^^
I had a flash of inspiration - a new special skill...!
^^^^
I... learned a special skill used by my friends――Arisen!
^^^^
There seems to be a job-training enemy in this area--
^^^^
You know, there's a training enemy out there--
^^^^
Arisen, your trial has been accomplished!
^^^^
There seems to be a valuable treasure nearby.
^^^^
Arisen, it seems there is a rare treasure nearby--
^^^^
Um - I'm kind of curious about this area.
^^^^
Hmmm, there's something going on here--
^^^^
There are enemies you don't see very often, what do you do--?
^^^^
This enemy is a rare one.
^^^^
What is this--?
^^^^
Arisen, h-how about tactical training?
^^^^
Well... please take your time.
^^^^
Um, it's an honor to meet you.
^^^^
Ya, I'll try!
^^^^
I understand--
^^^^
Recovery, yes!
^^^^
Wow!
^^^^
It won't hit!
^^^^
The flames seem to work!
^^^^
Ice seems to help!
^^^^
Lightning seems to work!
^^^^
Holy seems to work!
^^^^
Darkness seems to work!
^^^^
What could be here?
^^^^
It's creepy, but if you're with an Arisen――
^^^^
I'd like to be of more help to you, Arisen. I have one favor to ask--
^^^^
Thank you very much-- I will work hard so that you, Arisen, will be able to rely on me more with the power I have acquired.
^^^^
Dear Master, um, would you like to go on an adventure? I will be more useful to you than ever before.
^^^^
Nice to meet you!
^^^^
Let's go together!
^^^^
It's an honor to meet you!
^^^^
I will do my best to make it a pleasant journey.
^^^^
Please, use my powers to your liking.
^^^^
The Dragon is with us!
^^^^
Your friend is visible.
^^^^
Good work, Arisen!
^^^^
We did it!
^^^^
Bless me with the Dragon's protection.
^^^^
It's not going well.
^^^^
Good reaction.
^^^^
My power is overflowing!
^^^^
I'll show you I can be useful!
^^^^
Come on, let's go!
^^^^
Finally!
^^^^
Enemy sighted!
^^^^
There's an enemy there!
^^^^
There! Careful!
^^^^
That enemy is disgusting...
^^^^
A formidable foe! Stay vigilant!
^^^^
Thank you!
^^^^
Help me, quickly!
^^^^
Please help me!
^^^^
I...I messed up!
^^^^
Ugh...my strength!
^^^^
Negligence is forbidden!
^^^^
Come on, let's do this!
^^^^
Defeated!
^^^^
This is our victory!
^^^^
Looks like we survived.
^^^^
Do it now, Arisen!
^^^^
I still have plenty of fight left in me.
^^^^
This is a tough situation.
^^^^
At this rate we will be at a disadvantage!
^^^^
I've suffered...a grevious wound.
^^^^
I'm out of stamina!
^^^^
This can't be!
^^^^
Like this!
^^^^
I'm recovering.
^^^^
I will attract the enemy!
^^^^
This should be to our advantage now.
^^^^
Evading!
^^^^
Eat this!
^^^^
Aiming!
^^^^
I won't let go!
^^^^
Over here!
^^^^
Yes!
^^^^
Acknowledged!
^^^^
I won't follow.
^^^^
Arisen, are you ready for an adventure?
^^^^
If you're going out, please invite me if necessary.
^^^^
Please take your time, Arisen
^^^^
We fight every day, and we need rest.
^^^^
Good night, Dear Arisen. Have a pleasant dream
^^^^
Rest is also important preparation for the next step
^^^^
The atmosphere of the room has changed.
^^^^
It's a nice change of pace, a room makeover.
^^^^
Arisen, I have returned from exploring the area
^^^^
We've had very good results exploring the area this time!
^^^^
I see... Hmm...
^^^^
Look, it looks like something is coming to the garden.
^^^^
Fun Fun――　Fun　Fun――　(singing)
^^^^
I will do my best, Arisen.
^^^^
We will surely protect you with the armor we have received from you.
^^^^
These skills will help you!
^^^^
Oh, with this, it seems like I can fight in a different way.
^^^^
We've traveled quite a bit in the last few days, so let's take it easy for a while.
^^^^
Where shall I accompany you today?
^^^^
Yes, what is it?
^^^^
What's wrong, Lord Arisen?
^^^^
Master, I am with you!
^^^^
The other day, I was invited by another Arisen to assist with crafts!
^^^^
I recently accompanied another Arisen on an adventure I think I worked as we normally do!
^^^^
I recently received a compliment on my equipment from another Arisen
^^^^
Dear Arisen, today I have a proposal for a warfare technique!
^^^^
Dear Arisen, thanks to my service to you, my communication skills have improved!
^^^^
Dear Arisen, I have a hair style suggestion for you today!
^^^^
Arisen, it seems you have acquired new household goods! It will become even more comfortable!
^^^^
Welcome back, Master!
^^^^
Arisen, it's a relief that you have returned safely
^^^^
I was worried when you didn't return for a long time.
^^^^
You made it back safely, didn't you?
^^^^
Coming back here makes me feel at home.
^^^^
If you are worried about your physical strength, let's take a break.
^^^^
You are safe here.
^^^^
Arrived at the base, do we have any tools or information to gather?
^^^^
We are here to help you now!
^^^^
I'll come to you, please wait!
^^^^
Lord Arisen! Are you alright?
^^^^
Good luck!
^^^^
It's angry!　Please brace yourself!
^^^^
The enemy is in an excited state! Pay attention to the attacks!
^^^^
An opportunity has arisen! It's a chance!
^^^^
They're down! Let's go all out!
^^^^
I'm going to shake things up!
^^^^
Expose weaknesses! Everyone, attack!
^^^^
I will target weak points!
^^^^
We will assist you in taking the offensive!
^^^^
Lowering the enemy's attributes!
^^^^

^^^^
Dear Arisen, I've got a new Special Skill up my sleeve!
^^^^
I learned the Special Skill from the hired Pawn!
^^^^
Lord Arisen, It appears that there are job training enemies nearby.
^^^^
There is a training enemy there!
^^^^
Dear Arisen, It appears that you have achieved remarkable mastery in your training!
^^^^
Arisen,  It seems that there is a valuable treasure nearby.
^^^^
Dear Arisen, there may be a rare treasure in the vicinity
^^^^
Dear Arisen, there may be something nearby, please check.
^^^^
This place-- looks like it could be something.
^^^^
Dear Arisen, I have encountered an unexpected enemy!
^^^^
This enemy--unexpected.
^^^^
Item found.
^^^^
Dear Arisen, how about tactical training and such?
^^^^
The Lord has always taken care of me.
^^^^
You are a friend of the Lord. We have been waiting for you.
^^^^
Copy!
^^^^
I understand!
^^^^
I will heal you!
^^^^
Avoid!
^^^^
Dodge!
^^^^
Flame is a weakness!
^^^^
Ice is a weakness!
^^^^
Lightning is a weakness!
^^^^
Holy is a weak point!
^^^^
Darkness is a weakness!
^^^^
I hope you find something good.
^^^^
Let's get through this safely.
^^^^
Arisen, I have a matter to discuss with you in order to acquire a new power.
^^^^
Thanks to you, Master, I have gained new strength I will support you once again!
^^^^
Dear Arisen, please allow me to accompany you on your adventures I will be happy to support you!

'We have no choice but to believe that the Great Order is far more fragile than we have been led to believe.'
^^^^
'Because one man's ambition has changed the way the world is.'
^^^^
From the ancient document found at Erte Deenan
^^^^
The ancient manuscripts discovered in Erte Deenan told of the great kingdom of Lestania,
^^^^
where beneath the wings of the White Dragon
^^^^
its people were born,
^^^^
labored,
^^^^
and laughed.
^^^^
The civilization grew prosperous, with great reverence and gratitude to the White Dragon;
^^^^
its people grew in wisdom enough to try and seek overcoming death itself.
^^^^
However,
^^^^
323 years ago,
^^^^
a Golden Dragon emerged to challenge the White Dragon in battle.
^^^^
The battle between the two raged for over three days and three nights,
^^^^
while the people awaited the outcome with bated breath.
^^^^
And on the sunrise of the fourth day,
^^^^
Perhaps their prayers were answered.
^^^^
the White Dragon triumphed and struck the Golden Dragon down,
^^^^
but the White Dragon's bright resplendent wings lost their light,
^^^^
it fell.
^^^^
Though the people breathed sighs of relief at its triumph,
^^^^
the White Dragon had suffered a grievous wound in the battle.
^^^^
And thus
^^^^
it fell.
^^^^
The White Dragon raised its head and tried to climb and soar back into the skies;
^^^^
alas, it could not.
^^^^
The people then gathered around the injured dragon
^^^^
and prayed.
^^^^
Before long, the White Dragon said weakly,
^^^^
"I shall make you Arisen,"
^^^^
"and now"
^^^^
"you shall protect me instead."
^^^^
"For I cannot yet cease away,"
^^^^
"so you who have love for Lestania,"
^^^^
"build a stronghold to protect me."
^^^^
"Order must be"
^^^^
"restored to the land."
^^^^
And for the next some 300 years,
^^^^
the White Dragon increased the number of the Arisen, one at a time.
^^^^
And now,
^^^^
a newly Arisen
^^^^
will stand on the grounds of Lestania.

^^^^
Arisen―― Do you desire a new "Myrmidon's Pledge" with a pawn? If so, prove to me your qualification by presenting <COL b92828> <SPAI NUM> pieces of <SPAI NAME></COL>.
^^^^
--Ummm, Arisen, you are not yet ready to sign a new contract, it seems that you already control a number of Myrmidions in accordance with your capacity.
^^^^
--Arisen, apparently you don't yet have the required number of<COL b92828><SPAI NAME></COL> for a new contract with the Myrmidions!
^^^^
After you have the <COL b92828><SPAI NUM>pieces</COL> required for the covenant Show me the proof again...
^^^^
--I am ready. You who are to be given power, before me--
^^^^
Silence is the food of my willpower.
^^^^
The words to speak――Now there are none
^^^^
Feel the waves-- far, far beyond the horizon--
^^^^
When the soul is truly strong, the darkness will disappear.
^^^^
The mission of the Arisen, don't ever forget it.
^^^^
Oh, bewildered one, open your eyes without fear
^^^^
Anger without righteousness destroys--
^^^^
Train yourself You are the unsheathed blade――Sharpen or decay
^^^^
--For now... allow me to rest.
^^^^
I don't know if you've seen it all yet... or if you haven't.
^^^^
Spread the word-- Whoever wants to become an Arisen--I will not reject them.
^^^^
Arisen, remember the era of humans and cherish it with love.
^^^^
Arisen, become the wind and race across the earth - carry my soul
^^^^
O Arisen one-- Remember where you come from.
^^^^
More than 300 years have passed since then.
^^^^
It's not a short time for me either. For a man, no less...
^^^^
A world without dragons —
^^^^
We must not let Lestania become a land without dragons. We must avoid--
^^^^
--What's the matter?
^^^^
-- no, I wasn't asleep just occasionally -- I'd lose consciousness.
^^^^
Arisen, what do you want?
^^^^
My blessings in your words. Carry my favor to your people.
^^^^
I need rest.
^^^^
O Arisen One, Be my eyes and ears - I beseech you.
^^^^
The unusual presence doesn't weaken, it grows stronger. The girl emits a strong spirit, but that's not the only thing--
^^^^
The impure aura emanating from them seems similar to what monsters emit
^^^^
Do not take your eyes off the foreign girl―― Even though she is innocent, it is that girl who brings disaster upon us
^^^^
The curse of the black armor is troublesome, indeed
^^^^
Arisen. The unstable mind of a young human--
^^^^
It's out of my control. Keep an eye on it.
^^^^
Hmm. I seem to have lost more of my power than I realized.
^^^^
I sleep for a while, but-- even in slumber, I know when your spirit has changed. --don't worry...
^^^^
Forget about those who have departed.  The moment you think of depending on them... is the moment you seal your defeat
^^^^
Beyond the enemy at hand, there must be a true enemy. Don't lose sight of that.
^^^^
Arisen. I call upon you to travel throughout the land of Lestania and help your people. Spread my blessing far and wide.
^^^^
The malice will not disappear — The black malice that lurks in every corner of the darkness.
^^^^
Arisen,  Gaze upon your own darkness――
^^^^
Arisen ones―― Hasten your actions―― The malevolent energy grows stronger every day――
^^^^
It seems that the evil aura has slightly subsided. Strange... No, perhaps it's just hiding its presence...
^^^^
The flow of evil energy-- If you could feel it... If only you could sense it, too.
^^^^
Do not let yourself be dragged down by the whirlpool of regret. Only those who look ahead can cross the river.
^^^^
Oh... Leo...
^^^^
Hmm... I see. Alright then...
^^^^
Cecily is an Arisen, but still an aspiring one―― Oh, my Arisen―― search for the cause of it.
^^^^
Arisen―― My power cannot reach beyond the borders of Lestania. Let earth and man be your allies and your strength!
^^^^
In reverence to the dragons of Phindym, never to be forgotten.
^^^^
Arisen...  Hostility - Malice - It is the sensation that we, the dragons, most keenly sense.
^^^^
Hm... I sense the scent of a foreign land.
^^^^
Save the dragon-- Only the dragon will be able to tell us the truth.
^^^^
Is the cause of the anomaly the illness of the land--? Hmm--  Oh, Arisen-- this is deeply rooted--
^^^^
《Primeval Drops》 - Hm, I do not know.
^^^^
Dragons, the earth, and the people-- To restore the collapsed balance harmoniously is difficult --approach with care and sincerity.
^^^^
One may appear to be a servant of the dragon and the earth
^^^^
However, Arisen, it is good to learn.  The thoughts of man can sometimes drive even dragons mad.
^^^^
(With their eyes closed, they seem to be deep in thought)
^^^^
Behold the dragon of Phindym: His consciousness is faltering - it appears to be in turmoil..
^^^^
Direct your attention towards the dragon. Never forget, even for a moment.
^^^^
The spirit dragon knows itself. That's why they sent Cecily here. --Show them the truth of their decision.
^^^^
Worlds that stray from order, will return to order with this.
^^^^
A fireball in the sky like never before... The very foundation of order is being shaken...
^^^^
I feel a shifting of order-- What is going to happen--?
^^^^
Hmm... The smell has changed.  The dragon force of this land smells burnt.
^^^^
No sign of the evil dragon... 
^^^^
How much time did the prince spend with the fire dragon, who was supposedly slain by the black dragon?
^^^^
No contact from the "evil dragon"?
^^^^
According to Acre Selund custom, the prince is supposed to inherit the dragon.
^^^^
What if you were an "evil dragon"? I wouldn't let it run wild.
^^^^
To protect the young Arisen of Acre Selund, and teach them the path of the Arisen, there is no one else but you.
^^^^
The purpose of the "evil dragon" is unclear
^^^^
While it may seem unlikely, it is advisable to be wary of Prince Nedo's demeanor and actions.
^^^^
I find it hard to believe that the "evil dragon" would willingly relinquish its power. If that is the case, would it be possible to forcefully take it with all our strength? Is it truly feasible...?
^^^^
The whereabouts of the "Evil Dragon" and its Dragon Force will determine the future of Acre Selund.
^^^^
Regardless of the motives of the "Evil Dragon", if Prince Nedo becomes capable of inheriting the Dragon Force, there is only one path to pursue.
^^^^
It seems that the "Evil Dragon" is conceited, just like a human That could be its weakness
^^^^
It seems that the "Evil Dragon" is conceited, just like a human That could be its weakness
^^^^
In the great battle, you must watch out for the "evil dragon."
^^^^
How will your victory affect the evil dragon's agenda...
^^^^
Maybe they'll show themselves soon.
^^^^
I hear you're finally heading to the home of the "evil dragons" Keep an eye out for disturbances in nature.
^^^^
The knight in black armor-- I need you to hurry up and find out who he is.
^^^^
Well--the knight in black armor is nowhere to be seen.
^^^^
We must take back the dragon's force.
^^^^
I hear... voices...
^^^^
Mysial--
^^^^
I need you to let me live a little longer. I've got... some unfinished business....
^^^^
My stolen dragon force is not yet--
^^^^
Fortunately, all dragon force seems to have returned.
^^^^
If my body is nourished,  soon the earth will also return to its original state.
^^^^
Go on, go on, go. Here, I'm all right now.
^^^^
The prince's actions are filled with confidence and conviction. Don't you think so?
^^^^
The "Evil Dragon" has not yet moved.
^^^^
What logic is there in knowing that the prince has a flute... I wonder if it works
^^^^
The prince seems to believe that with a flute, he can beat the dragon--
^^^^
The enemy's aim is unclear-- What do they seek by undermining order?--
^^^^
Be sure to take a good look at the 'Evil Dragon,' as we cannot say for certain that the same thing will not happen in this land.
^^^^
I have something important to tell you. When you're healthy, both mentally and physically-- please.
^^^^
You don't look well. Please take care of yourself.
^^^^
The words of the White Dragon are indeed the guiding light.
^^^^
When in doubt, listen, and let the teachings of The White Dragon guide you!
^^^^
If the surface of the heart is calm, then the true essence of the dragon's heart can be understood by anyone.
^^^^
I'm a little... distracted at the moment. Please be patient.
^^^^
You are an Arisen. The path of hardship cannot be avoided.
^^^^
Humans are weak ―― that is why we weave together and gather our strength.
^^^^
Let us believe in  the great blessings of the White Dragon.
^^^^
We hope for a world without strife, but our hands are stained with the blood of war - a vain thing!
^^^^
Something to tell — something to convey... The important words are always taught by The White Dragon. Yes — it is not my own words.
^^^^
Hello, Arisen
^^^^
Welcome back. By the way, have I greeted everyone yet?
^^^^
Until the day The White Dragon is restored, let's do our best together
^^^^
There are more Arisen behaving freely, but please always keep in mind that it is thanks to The White Dragon that they exist.
^^^^
I heard that you got involved in a dispute between the Knights order and the Arisen. Are you okay?
^^^^
Some people seem to think that bickering is the source of energy. I don't understand it at all--I've never understood it.
^^^^
Did you get to meet Alvar? I hope you can get to the contract soon.
^^^^
I'm supposed to help with the contract , so I'm looking forward to that time 
^^^^
I'm happy to help Now you're a well-known Arisen!
^^^^
Even though it has only been a short time since becoming an Arisen, I can't believe you brought back a "Blood Orb"
^^^^
Maybe the White Dragon has secretly given us a blessing 
^^^^
I'm sorry I made such a fuss about the smell of orcs. I'm sorry... I'm afraid of that smell.
^^^^
Have you learned of Mayleaf's true identity? That family is now the jewel of this Lestania.
^^^^
No wonder they were the target of demons. Please, please, please take care of them!
^^^^
The White Dragon's recovery has been a step in the right direction-- The petrification symptoms can be especially tricky!
^^^^
If only I could get more Blood Orbs.
^^^^
Iris is still acting weird. Can you tell her I want to talk to her?
^^^^
Leo was staring at The White Dragon He seemed to be pondering--
^^^^
I hear it was a tough fight, and a lot of lives were cut short--
^^^^
But the lives dedicated to the White Dragon will not be in vain.
^^^^
I hope to see the White Dragon flying in the sky-- one day!
^^^^
If it means that the elf's friends will be taken care of, it might be better for Mayleaf. Maybe--
^^^^
Iris--I'm worried.
^^^^
Will this continue to happen in the future--?
^^^^
I hope everyone in the city below can live in peace. Please do help us to do so.
^^^^
The life of an elf taken away... What will the enemy do?
^^^^
It was a strong, clear life. The way he lived his life was amazing.
^^^^
I have to say--thank you for that.
^^^^
It will take some time for The White Dragon to recover. We must continue to protect him--
^^^^
Thank you for taking on the impossible.
^^^^
I may have spoiled it a little I'll be careful from now on.
^^^^
I heard about Iris--
^^^^
Can we go back to the way things used to be? What impression did you get?
^^^^
The enemy is Diamantes--
^^^^
I can't envision it as well as I did with the orcs. But The White Dragon is radiating a strong aura of hatred-- that much I know!
^^^^
Oh, sorry I don't really have anything to tell you right now.
^^^^
Having a little chat with you? Great!　Okay, let's find something we have in common.
^^^^
Sorry, I just have a few things to think about. We can talk later.
^^^^
Oh, you're tired, aren't you? I guess even the Arisen aren't invincible.
^^^^
You know what they say about the right person for the right job? Yes, I attack with wisdom, not military prowess.
^^^^
Thinking outside the box  That's what transforms ordinary into extraordinary
^^^^
This feeling of mixed anxiety and anticipation-- It's hard to explain.
^^^^
Books you haven't read yet, experiments you haven't tried yet-- You can't die while you have regrets.
^^^^
Do you like this world? I do. The more you know-- the more you want to know.
^^^^
When you have an idea, act on it immediately! You won't find anything if you wait.
^^^^
Hmm?　What's wrong?
^^^^
Hello, new person. It's good to make yourself known to everyone at first, regardless of who they are.
^^^^
It's good to always keep in mind about the 《Blood Orb》,  because when you find it, you're sure to be admired.
^^^^
I learned the art of worldly wisdom being caught up in the conflict between the Arisen and the knights.
^^^^
--I'm going to try to think positively and this is another way to get by, I guess.
^^^^
――!? Ah, sorry, sorry I was just thinking about something
^^^^
Since becoming Joseph's assistant, this is the first big job I've been entrusted with, and I am now tasked with the planning... hehehe...
^^^^
A gigantic stone monument fell from the sky...
^^^^
I still do not know what it truly is, but it seems to have fallen somewhere Have you heard any rumors or something?
^^^^
I'm reflecting on it--yes. Oh, it's you--I thought I was going to be scolded again.
^^^^
No, I caused you to worry too, didn't I? Thank you for coming to pick me up. I really appreciate it.
^^^^
Sorry! The Ark's investigation report is the top priority. I can't focus on other things.
^^^^
Despite the fact that the report on the Ark investigation is not yet complete, up until the deciphering of the ancient documents--
^^^^
But, the old document you took home seems interesting... Uh-oh... I'm going to get scolded by Joseph, aren't I?
^^^^
Did you talk to Iris? I can't help but feel like she's avoiding me.
^^^^
Perhaps, I may be able to become a powerful Arisen..
^^^^
It's a little scary―― but look, The White Dragon is waiting for you.
^^^^
How about it? Are you used to the life of an Arisen?
^^^^
Since you became an Arisen, there have been different incidents occurring from before until now.  The Orcs have become more active, and, well, the appearance of the Ark, too.
^^^^
And it seems that a new method to encourage the recovery of The White Dragon has been found. I feel like more things are going to happen from now on.
^^^^
The woman in the hood who took Mayleaf out... I knew it was her.
^^^^
Diamantes -  Iris did say that, right?
^^^^
Ahahaha―― Who would have thought that the area near the temple would turn into a battlefield―― Oh, how scary.
^^^^
It's lonely, isn't it... I felt like we could become close... No, we were close, right...
^^^^
Even if the life was useful to Master White Dragon, the knowledge, the wisdom that Keith Hilt knew-- it's all gone.
^^^^
I knew I wanted to talk more with Keith Hilt. I just wish I could have told you more--
^^^^
A meeting? Oh, this is going to take some time.
^^^^
I don't think this is the time for that, but it's nice to have some time. I am thinking of researching on my own.
^^^^
There are some ancient documents that have not yet been fully read, and I may need to reevaluate what I've actually done so far.
^^^^
I want to go investigate too-- but I'm holding back because making a fuss here might put me in an even more troublesome position 
^^^^
That's strange-- I was in charge of investigating the first Ark.
^^^^
If I were to go on this investigation, I would have been able to compare it to the last time --  But I don't get listened to at all -- sigh.
^^^^
I am indeed a descendant of an alchemist, but so what?
^^^^
You know me better than anyone, Joseph. I should have known...
^^^^
I had noticed-- that Iris had changed a little 
^^^^
And yet, I can't help but regret and regret.
^^^^
I don't--I don't want any more regrets. I knew the signs were there. There was no need to hesitate...
^^^^
I absolutely don't want to lose any more friends, so I intend to speak my mind.
^^^^
I can't stay still here. I'm going to Mergoda! I'm definitely going!
^^^^
I am happy that there was an alchemist who could oppose Diamantes.
^^^^
That's why I want to become a bridge between the people on this side and the temple.
^^^^
You'll also help me, right? We've been together for quite a long time, after all... You know that I don't have any ambitions, don't you?
^^^^
The time has come--right?
^^^^
I keep thinking-- that Diamantes wants me to follow in his footsteps. Did he really think--?
^^^^
If that's the case, it's pitiful, isn't it? Are there really no other candidates for the successor besides me, someone you just met?
^^^^
To the knights who went out into the storm, I salute you
^^^^
Next is the turn of the Arisen, Please be careful.
^^^^
It's bad, isn't it? I can't help but think about Leo. Why is he absent at a time like this?
^^^^
I think other people feel the same way. In other words-- What I want to say is, it's tough to be Leo's successor, but I hope you will do your best.
^^^^
The problem is the location of the island you and Gurdolin say you went to.
^^^^
The charts of all of Lestania are to be gathered here in this temple. I'll be poring over them with the sailors.
^^^^
It's not easy to find an island floating in the open sea.
^^^^
I was prepared, you know―― No, no, I will not be deterred!
^^^^
I feel relieved that the island has been found. It's like a burden has been lifted off my shoulders. Just between you and me-- Master Joseph is testing me.
^^^^
Whether I am suitable to be a future priest-- Although I desired the position so much that I would give my right arm for it, I wonder now, how about it--
^^^^
Rather than calling it a step-by-step strategy, it's more like defeating each individual. Some people argue that it's best to solve things one by one, but I'm not sure that it's a good idea.
^^^^
I enjoy seeking solutions in the midst of confusion. In other words, this busyness is also on my side.
^^^^
We are still conducting investigations on the island. I hope we can make a good report, but there are quite a few monsters.
^^^^
Because the Knights sometimes conduct sweeps Well, be patient-- Oh, patience!　We're not very good at that. (sigh)
^^^^
If I could talk to the person Leo is hiding with, I would probably understand more. But right now, it's more about defeating the Corruption. Seriously, it's one thing after another--
^^^^
I think I'll continue to investigate that island more thoroughly. Although the fighting may have come to a halt, the investigation is far from over.
^^^^
I also wanted to join you on the island, but it seems it's still too early. I'll wait a little longer for the situation to settle down.
^^^^
I hear the monsters that appeared on the island are considerably different from the previous Corruption?
^^^^
From the perspective of the relationship between the Black Knight and monsters, it could be said that the newcomer is a presence closer to the Black Knight.
^^^^
I hope Loeg gets better soon. Well, it's not so much for Loeg's sake but rather for quite selfish reasons.
^^^^
Even if uncertain, Loeg remembers various things, so I must be grateful for that information alone.
^^^^
Cecily has suffered a serious injury. If there is no fatal wound, she should survive, but recovery will take a long time.
^^^^
Well, let's pray that they'll survive.
^^^^
It's frustrating. There are so many things I don't know. Being reminded of that... Ah, it's frustrating.
^^^^
Let's say I'm one step ahead of you guys That's my job, right?
^^^^
That gate is the result of the power of Phindym's dragon. It can't be done with just our determination alone.
^^^^
Regarding the sustainability of the gate, I cannot go over there without a little more certainty.
^^^^
This body that is not an Arisen is filled with resentment.
^^^^
When listening to Joseph's story, it feels as if we are invaders to Phindym.
^^^^
Over there and here,  The positions are evenly split—I believe that this way of thinking  Leads to peaceful coexistence.
^^^^
When I think about it, even in this Lestania, the dragon's condition continues to worsen, doesn't it?
^^^^
If that's the case, it might be incredibly lucky that the chaos in Lestania has been settled to this extent.
^^^^
The mechanism of Dragon Force circulating around Phindym seems to be a little different from here.
^^^^
I wonder if it means that the dragon and the tree are sharing circulation and purification - or maybe it means that there is little objection towards the dragon.
^^^^
According to what I've heard, Cecily's father is not a warrior or anything, he seems to be an ordinary person.
^^^^
You're worried, too, aren't you? You'd better get there as soon as possible.
^^^^
Come on, the guys are waiting for you, okay? You'll handle it-- I'm sure a lot of them think so.
^^^^
Loeg did not have a favorable opinion of the Gearóid tribal leaders. No, it's more like he held a grudge against them, I guess?
^^^^
Did the Black Knight enter the dark depths of your heart?
^^^^
That Loeg, though... He seemed like a good-hearted guy. I still have a long way to go in judging people.
^^^^
There was a detour, but now it's time. I'll be waiting for good news!
^^^^
I assume the purification has begun? I'm curious to see the progress.
^^^^
Please be careful and make sure to return here safely. I want you to promise me that. You are witnesses to history, after all.
^^^^
The number of travelers to Phindym is likely to increase from now on, and of course, I am also preparing for it.
^^^^
I cannot return without the Arisen being present, so I ask you all to take care of me at that time.
^^^^
I want to record what happened in Phindym and leave it for future generations to see--
^^^^
It feels like something is about to happen again.
^^^^
Is this Acre Selund? The natural environment here is almost the same, right? In other words, it's a world of order and dragons.
^^^^
The situation in Acre Selund doesn't seem to be good, but even so, you are representatives of Lestania.
^^^^
Please do it with a smile, if possible
^^^^
In any case, you are Prince Nedo now.
^^^^
The Liberation Army has certainly stimulated the enemy since they have arrived here. We must be prepared for counterattacks.
^^^^
When it comes to thieves, they are often considered rough individuals. Since we are infiltrating their headquarters, be careful with your words and actions.
^^^^
I need to make sure to tell Gurdolin firmly.
^^^^
Next is the orc's stronghold, huh? I wonder if you guys are more familiar with that.
^^^^
Prince Nedo and the liberation army have joined forces Enemy vigilance will also intensify, I suppose.
^^^^
Is a full-scale war against the "Evil Dragon" about to begin in Acre Selund?
^^^^
I hope we can establish a friendly relationship with Acre Selund, just like with Phindym.
^^^^
Do not extinguish the flame of hope that has been lit in Acre Selund!
^^^^
You yourselves also have hope, Please do not forget that.
^^^^
The only thing I understood is that the "Evil Dragon" has no intention of taking you out immediately.
^^^^
I think this is not a bad thing.
^^^^
Joseph is currently a bundle of suspicion. It's not surprising no matter what he says.
^^^^
Joseph is currently a bundle of suspicion. It's not surprising no matter what he says.
^^^^
Is it a vacation before a serious castle attack?
^^^^
Lestania is a peaceful place. How about taking a walk for a change of mood?
^^^^
To gather strength at the recaptured castle and aim to defeat the "Evil Dragon," right?
^^^^
The journey seems to still have a long way to go, so we must proceed carefully.
^^^^
I bumped it this morning and chipped a nail. I have a bad feeling about this.
^^^^
The topic of the mysterious knight is all the buzz, right? Regardless of their identity, they are definitely a formidable opponent. So, let's prepare ourselves for anything, okay?
^^^^
I can't calm down until the battle in the Royal Capital is over.
^^^^
I think it's best to focus on the battle to recapture the Royal Capital with the Liberation Army.
^^^^
Write down all possible measures and thoroughly scrutinize them.
^^^^
And if there is something good, I will also let you guys know.
^^^^
I'm hitting various books and such, but this crisis is unprecedented. It feels like The White Dragon and we are experiencing something for the first time.
^^^^
Please, I beg you- Retrieve the sword of The Black Knight.
^^^^
Come on, hurry up.
^^^^
Cecily's Dragon Force, which helps you, is merely a temporary power. I don't think it will last long.
^^^^
Lestania's fate was on the brink of exhaustion ―― Ahaha―― My legs are trembling now.
^^^^
Prince Nedo is certainly still a child, but from what I hear, he gives the impression of not doing anything reckless.
^^^^
If he disappeared, there must have been some deep reason behind it. I hope it's something that can be resolved.
^^^^
Joseph is saying something again, right? It's in his nature to suspect others.
^^^^
I think this is an action that the prince has carefully considered. Otherwise, it wouldn't match the impression of the prince that I have heard from you.
^^^^
I'm sure the prince has a purpose, but--
^^^^
After achieving that goal, I wonder what expression they will have when they return to their comrades. I wonder if they haven't thought about it much.
^^^^
Firefall Mountain is the dwelling place of the "Evil Dragon," right?
^^^^
Since we could be attacked at any time, let's stay on high alert in all directions
^^^^
Going back and forth, you've had it tough.
^^^^
I used to think it was enviable But lately ―― ah, I guess I've also gotten older
^^^^
It would be better to quickly head towards Acre Selund; the situation can change depending on the prince's movements.
^^^^
Can't we consider the "Evil Dragon" as a child who has been bestowed with power alone?
^^^^
They gave no knowledge, no experience, just power. There was no balance... No, no, no, that's not the point!
^^^^
Who gave -- or didn't give -- What we should be thinking about is who was behind it
^^^^
What's worrying you?
^^^^
If there is something on your mind, I recommend resolving it promptly.
^^^^
The power of you Arisen is the hope that remains for us.
^^^^
Hmm, I wonder... Must be getting old―― I had something I wanted to talk about, but I forgot.
^^^^
It is difficult to fully understand the intentions of the White Dragon, even if one is a priestess.
^^^^
We must always discipline ourselves and be prepared for unforeseen circumstances. I understand this, but... it's quite difficult.
^^^^
Arisen, I'm counting on you. Your work will determine the outcome for many.
^^^^
To weave the will of the dragon That is what will save us from disaster
^^^^
What's wrong? Is there something that's making you anxious? First, you guys need to calm down.
^^^^
In front of the serene and simply existing world-- We are so small and immature, aren't we?
^^^^
There could be no priest who has experienced such turmoil as I have. Well, should I rejoice or should I lament?
^^^^
I stand here all day long, thinking about dragons and thinking about politics. I don't have much time to think about you all, but well, it's forgivable.
^^^^
The world outside of Order--
^^^^
If there is such a world, I can't imagine what kind of reasoning would work there--I can't imagine it!
^^^^
Ah, sorry. I was lost in thought.
^^^^
I smell orcs in the air. You better be careful in the temple.
^^^^
Find some time and go outside and see for yourself.
^^^^
The cultivation of an Arisen ultimately comes down to experience. No, this applies not only to Arisens.
^^^^
I'm sending a survey team soon and I'm somewhat busy with the selection process.
^^^^
Is the contract with the Pawn progressing? Once it's finished, you'll finally become a full-fledged Arisen.
^^^^
Hmm― It seems like you're steadily climbing the steps as an Arisen. That's reliable.
^^^^
How many times have you been to the fort and back?
^^^^
It is important to go and see for yourself, not just in the fortress but also in various places. Even if you look at the map, it won't make sense in your head.
^^^^
From one thing to another―― how are we supposed to handle this? Just dealing with the orcs themselves is already tough enough, and now it's the Ark?
^^^^
You'll be busy too, so when you can take a break, take it.
^^^^
Mayleaf's true identity is a secret it's a promise
^^^^
Did you go somewhere? Hmmm... This has the smell of a secret.
^^^^
Is Iris really okay?
^^^^
We have to let the Arisen take care of the Arisen. You're going to have to watch them very closely.
^^^^
Leo seems to be having trouble--
^^^^
Is it really necessary to make one's weaknesses so obvious...
^^^^
I cannot agree, but I have no intention of calling it meaningless.
^^^^
For the Arisen, the more power they are given, the slower The White Dragon's recovery becomes— It can be thought of that way.
^^^^
The Arisen's true duty is to aid in the recovery of The White Dragon. - Never, ever forget that.
^^^^
Kieshildt―― If they live here, we can feel at ease But that species is obstinate――
^^^^
Using Iris to understand the enemy――a single strategy.
^^^^
No, even I am surprised and my heart hurts --
^^^^
However, I cannot continue to trust someone who has been swayed by the enemy as before.
^^^^
The name of the person who sent the Ark is -  No, let's stop here.
^^^^
It's strange-- Ever since I discovered that there are other elves besides Mayleaf, there has been a sense of relief in the back of my mind.
^^^^
It was not only Mayleaf who was targeted. I could only be surprised by my own selfishness.
^^^^
Proud, lonely souls--
^^^^
I'm glad we can welcome you here. Ah, this is sincere.
^^^^
Do you want to attend the meeting? Please focus on preparing for the battle instead.
^^^^
Where to go and how to fight―― Just fight without thinking, as we will do the thinking for you.
^^^^
I am aware that there is dissatisfaction with the length of the meeting. However, this matter will greatly impact the future of Lestania.
^^^^
We shouldn't jump to conclusions in a hurry.
^^^^
Is Leo here yet? We need to discuss future plans and how to handle Iris. If you see him, tell him to come here immediately.
^^^^
Leave the strategy for the Ark to me - Now, go and rest while you can.
^^^^
Mysial knew the recent rumors about Iris.
^^^^
I mean, they should have been warned. So why--
^^^^
No way, not even Leo-- No, that's not-- hey?
^^^^
Now, you're going to Mergoda. Who to talk to over there - who to fight. You should decide that for yourself.
^^^^
You will never make a mistake Ah, I believe in you
^^^^
Did you see Leo? Tell him I was worried.
^^^^
Now, while you're at it, get some rest and review your equipment-- It's time for the showdown!
^^^^
No sign of Leo, but he'll be back soon.
^^^^
It is best to report to The White Dragon personally. There is no harm in talking about it later.
^^^^
Such a storm―― It has never happened since the beginning of the compilation of historical records. For future generations, detailed records must be kept.
^^^^
Looks like another restless day ahead.
^^^^
Use Gurdolin, Lise, and Elliot effectively to help us overcome this difficulty Of course, I will do anything I can.
^^^^
Regardless of what may happen, we had hoped that we wouldn't be involved, but sure enough, it seems like we've picked up a burnt stone.
^^^^
From the looks of it, Cecily has the air of a maiden with an innocent heart...
^^^^
Why on earth is Cecily being targeted?
^^^^
When the knight order and the Arisen join forces and fight together, There is no opponent we cannot defeat.
^^^^
I believe that if we keep fighting all the time, it will be impossible to grasp the situation. I still cannot avoid the division of forces.
^^^^
There are a number of problems, but can we at least eliminate the Corruption demon? That would make manpower allocation a lot easier.
^^^^
Leo didn't say anything?
^^^^
If the situation changes, change your way of thinking That flexibility was a virtue, but- Has that even changed too?
^^^^
Those invaders-- they're the reason I can't even think straight.
^^^^
In order to take the lead, it is crucial to engage in in-depth contemplation and reflection.
^^^^
There should be a silver lining by now-- Although I told Cecily not to rush I'm probably the one who needs to calm down the most.
^^^^
How'd it go? I'm waiting for good news.
^^^^
The story of a strong psychological impact that robs people of their memory has been known since ancient times.
^^^^
I wonder what the circumstances are in Cecily's case.
^^^^
If Loeg's illness is what I think it is he must be in a lot of pain I hope I can help him soon.
^^^^
Oh my goodness -  Absolutely -
^^^^
After trying to jog Loeg's and Cecily's memories and failing, I can't help but feel a sense of unease.
^^^^
Now... I only feel ashamed for thinking of Cecily with such animosity, and I can only pray for her recovery.
^^^^
Please, whatever bond you have with Leo-- or whatever feud you have with him-- your priority right now is to help Cecily.
^^^^
Cecily survived So that's one sorrow gone. Let's move forward again!
^^^^
If you have the time, just check in with me once in a while to see what's going on on the island.
^^^^
See with your own eyes what it is like to be in another land.
^^^^
Don't worry about anything here. And then, when interacting with residents of Phindym, don't forget your dignity.
^^^^
Come on, hurry up and go to Phindym While I believe in his safety, I'm also concerned about Gurdolin's well-being.
^^^^
Phindym's people must know about Phindym.
^^^^
There might be a solution, or something that can be done Listen carefully and provide assistance
^^^^
It would be boring to just sit and wait for the arrival of 《Primeval Drops》. Now, go to Phindym and lend a hand.
^^^^
The stolen 《Primeval Drops》-- I don't care if you go a little overboard, you must get them back!
^^^^
I will treat Cecily well, okay? Please, form a strong bond of friendship Do not lose to small conflicts or disputes, maintain a strong bond.
^^^^
Cecily, do you feel like you're being crushed under the weight of heavy responsibilities? Stay by her side and support her.
^^^^
The White Dragon is trying to communicate with the spirit dragon Willmia of Phindym, but it doesn't seem to be going well.
^^^^
You guys must be busy too, but please try to care.
^^^^
Sometimes, is it still unknown where Loeg is. Is it possible that he is seeking salvation?
^^^^
I would like to see him again and hear his true intentions.
^^^^
I heard about Loeg It is truly regrettable but - -
^^^^
Together with the earth of Phindym, his darkness will also be purified.
^^^^
The complete recovery of Phindym will still take a long time. Please check in occasionally and report on the progress.
^^^^
This is a good omen - good things are beginning.
^^^^
I'm trying to tell myself that but it's not easy to--
^^^^
To remain alone in a foreign land, I'll have to revise my assessment of Elliott.
^^^^
Even if I try to give instructions or advice, there is not enough information.
^^^^
For a while, please handle things flexibly and adapt as you see fit.
^^^^
Do you think you and General Meirova will get along well?
^^^^
First of all, if the prince doesn't come back, there's no way to make a move.
^^^^
From the stories I hear, it seems that Prince Nedo is not a bad person at heart. He has built friendly relationships.
^^^^
I hear you're going to ride into an enemy stronghold. Take care.
^^^^
The rescue mission of Prince Nedo, which was the immediate objective, has ended as planned.
^^^^
I'm curious about the next move.
^^^^
If the goal of the Liberation Army is to defeat the "evil dragon," what path will it take next?
^^^^
There is no need to be stingy with collaboration, but don't forget about the benefit of Lestania.
^^^^
With the recent momentum gained by the People's Liberation Army, the chaos in Acre Selund is expected to further escalate.
^^^^
I hope it's a short war.
^^^^
The enemy's offensive is predictable.
^^^^
General Meirova is also likely taking measures If we endure, the future will be bright
^^^^
"Evil Dragon," beware! After Acre Selund, is Lestania--
^^^^
If that's your intention, it's extremely presumptuous.
^^^^
Can we take the words of the "Evil Dragon" literally? I don't know if I believe it.
^^^^
Ah--the swamp of doubt is bottomless.
^^^^
Can we take the words of the "Evil Dragon" literally? I don't know if I believe it.
^^^^
Ah--the swamp of doubt is bottomless.
^^^^
I guess it goes without saying-- Taking back the castle won't be so easy.
^^^^
Even though danger is inevitable, you must refrain from reckless behavior.
^^^^
The fulfillment of the long-held dream of regaining the castle that was taken from us I'm sure the liberation army is very happy to see you.
^^^^
I can't help but smile when I think about it.
^^^^
The "Evil Dragon" referred to as the Land of Despair. The situation of Acre Selund has greatly changed.
^^^^
When it comes to this, his silence is eerie.
^^^^
You guys are the same, right? But inside my head, it's filled with black-clad knights.
^^^^
"Evil Dragon" and the black knight, for that matter, To manipulate us without showing their true forms— How despicable these individuals are.
^^^^
Calm down――You need to calm down.
^^^^
Blood orbs are gathering one after another, but it must be said that their effectiveness is weak.
^^^^
The future of Lestania depends on your actions
^^^^
Looking back, the White Dragon in my memories was always sick and suffering However, this is the first time I have witnessed such a painful situation.
^^^^
I guess there is no time left for another moment of delay. Now, please go.
^^^^
You've worked hard. Please take a rest.
^^^^
No, of course, it's good to sing, eat, and talk a lot.  Do as you like. Let's consider even the small things a little more.
^^^^
According to what Lise told me, it seems that Prince Nedo is missing, and furthermore, he seems to have left the castle on his own accord.
^^^^
What on earth is going on at this point?
^^^^
I may be disliked again for saying this, but there is a possibility that Acre Selund is conspiring and trying to deceive us.
^^^^
Don't make that face. It's just a discussion of possibilities.
^^^^
Given the situation ―― considering the previous circumstances, it is hard to believe that the prince has any ill intentions.
^^^^
However... If we do not value and appreciate those who serve us a little more, it will be difficult to govern the country.
^^^^
Of course, it is important to promptly ensure the prince's safety and have respectful discussions.
^^^^
However, perhaps it would be better for just you guys to start shifting your feelings towards defeating the dragon.
^^^^
Hmm―― Even though there are countless important things to consider, I can't help but think only about Elliot.
^^^^
Dragon and Dragon Force, along with the blessings of the earth, are inseparable. Therefore, a continent without dragons is unimaginable.
^^^^
Don't you think it's impossible to defeat a dragon without inheriting the power of Dragon Force Augmentation?
^^^^
Well, well... I must record this incident.
^^^^
It seems that I also need to visit Acre Selund at least once.
^^^^
Oh, you brought the 《LV.80 Orb of Growth》 This is quite a valuable item that you've obtained.
^^^^
With this, you can raise your current job to level 80. You can also raise the limit for skills and abilities, except for special ones. And of course, job points can be accumulated up to the new limit.
^^^^
If you brought this, does that mean you will use 《「LV.80」Orb of Growth》 with your current job?
^^^^
Yes
^^^^
No
^^^^
I see. It's valuable, so be sure to think carefully and use it.
^^^^
--Sorry about this The 《「LV.80」Orb of Growth》 has no effect on that job. Think again with a different job.
^^^^
Now let us release the power of the Orb --Quiet your mind and close your eyes.
^^^^
It seems like I've safely reached level 80. Now, it's time for skills. ―― Close your eyes once again.
^^^^
Check your skills only after you've calmed down. Okay, the last thing you need is abilities. --Close your eyes and concentrate.
^^^^
Now all the abilities of this job are yours, except for the special ones!
^^^^
How you have grown is not apparent from your appearance, so I recommend going to Archibald's place and checking to confirm.
^^^^
It may take a little time to unleash the power of the treasure. It would be better for the party to disband once and come back. You may end up keeping the party members waiting unnecessarily.
^^^^
I guess you've noticed, but this job has already reached level 80. The effects of leveling up would be wasted, but are you still going to use the treasure?
^^^^
Yes
^^^^
No
^^^^
Hmm―― It seems that there are no skills that can be raised even if you use the 《「LV.80」Orb of Growth》 on this job. Although the effects related to skills will be wasted, is it okay to use the orb?
^^^^
Yes
^^^^
No
^^^^
This... even if you use the 《「LV.80」Orb of Growth》 at this level, it seems there are no abilities to be raised. Are you going to use the orb with your current job?
^^^^
Yes
^^^^
No
^^^^
I see. If you're satisfied, I have nothing more to say.
^^^^
Now, let us release the power of the Orb. Quiet your mind and close your eyes.
^^^^
This is a jewel imbued with strong Dragon Force. If you offer it to the White Dragon, your 《Dragon Force Augmentation》 will become complete.
^^^^
Does bringing it here mean that I am now allowed to unleash the Dragon Force contained within this jewel?
^^^^
Yes
^^^^
No
^^^^
Hmm... You have already completed the "Dragon Force Augmentation" inheritance, haven't you?
^^^^
It seems that this orb was unnecessary for you, who has polished your skills on your own. Truly, you are an Arisen.
^^^^
While there is no effect on 《Dragon Force Augmentation》, In celebration of the future, should we release the power of the jewel? The power will revolve around the land and one day, it will return to you.
^^^^
All the 《Dragon Force Augmentation》 have been completed. Confirm what kind of power you have obtained!
^^^^
The Orb that you brought with you is said to make it easier to embark on adventures by unleashing its hidden power.
^^^^
For example, it works by increasing the rank of each area or releasing Portcrystals that can be used as a Rift Teleport destination.
^^^^
Now then, should we unleash the power of this orb?
^^^^
Yes
^^^^
No
^^^^
Come to think of it, you've already touched quite a few Portcrystals and contributed to the area, haven't you?
^^^^
Even if the power of this Orb is released, there may not be any significant effect obtained. Nevertheless, may I release the power of this Orb?
^^^^
Yes
^^^^
No
^^^^
By releasing the power of the Orb, your ties to the regions will grow stronger.
^^^^
I have unleashed the power of the Orb. Even if the original effect cannot be obtained, The unleashed power will traverse the land, And one day, it will surely return to you.
^^^^
Wow, You brought 《<VAL>》!  This is another valuable thing you've got.
^^^^
With this, you can raise your current job and your skills and abilities to the maximum, except for special ones.
^^^^
《<VAL>》 Will you release the power of this treasure?
^^^^
Yes
^^^^
No
^^^^
It may take a little time to unleash the power of the treasure. It would be better for the party to disband once and come back. You may end up keeping the party members waiting unnecessarily.
^^^^
Hmm... In this job, even if you use《<VAL>》, the effects of leveling up will be wasted. Are you still going to use the treasure orb?
^^^^
Yes
^^^^
No
^^^^
Hmm―― It seems that there are no skills to release by using 《<VAL>》 in this job. Although the effects related to skills will be wasted, is it okay to use the orb?
^^^^
Yes
^^^^
No
^^^^
This... even if you use the《<VAL>》as is, it seems there are no usable abilities. Are you going to use the orb with your current job?
^^^^
Yes
^^^^
No
^^^^
I see. If you're satisfied, I have nothing more to say.
^^^^
-- Good. Looks like you're safe and leveled up.
^^^^
――Alright. It appears that the skill has been unlocked successfully.
^^^^
――It seems that the abilities have been successfully unlocked.
^^^^
Now, go forth, Arisen May you be blessed by the White Dragon's grace.
^^^^
Now let us release the power of the Orb --Quiet your mind and close your eyes.
^^^^
I see. It's valuable, so be sure to think carefully and use it.
^^^^
Well, this is 《<VAL>》 
^^^^
By using this, you will be able to unlock the skills and abilities of your current job.
^^^^
《<VAL>》 Will you release the power of this treasure?
^^^^
Yes
^^^^
No
^^^^
Hmm... You have already completed the "Dragon Force Augmentation" inheritance, haven't you?
^^^^
You have already contributed to many areas. Even if the power of this Orb is released, there may not be any significant effect obtained. Nevertheless, may I release the power of this Orb?
^^^^
Yes
^^^^
No
^^^^
Even if the power of this Orb is released, it will have no effect on the Portcrystals. Nevertheless, may I release the power of this Orb?
^^^^
All the 《Dragon Force Augmentation》 have been completed. Confirm what kind of power you have obtained!
^^^^
This will strengthen the connection between each area and yourself
^^^^
――With this, it seems that the Portcrystals have been successfully unlocked.
^^^^
What's wrong? You look serious.
^^^^
Have you become accustomed to being an Arisen? Did the path become visible?
^^^^
You've got to keep your body in shape.
^^^^
Sorry If it's just casual conversation, please save it for later.
^^^^
To live as an Arisen means to witness the fate of The White Dragon and the world.
^^^^
Let's do what we have to do--for each other.
^^^^
Don't let your guard down. There is no such thing as an absolutely safe place.
^^^^
You want to try your hand at a fight? Oops, don't give me that look--I'm kidding.
^^^^
Have you ever felt it? The intense thing that pierces through your core - The uncertainty that wavers and breaks.
^^^^
Do not forget We are the Arisen - those who live and die for the mission.
^^^^
What's wrong? No need to hesitate with me.
^^^^
There is no free time for an arisen――as always.
^^^^
Let me make it clear, the only thing I can do for you is to give you directions on where you should go - only instructions on who you should engage in battle with.
^^^^
I can't take care of your food and clothing, so you're on your own.
^^^^
Make time to walk around as much as possible. You can look all over the temple or go far away!
^^^^
Explore without forgetting your heart and always touch something new. The life of an Arisen is long. It is painful to be bored.
^^^^
Do you know the story of the Ark?
^^^^
I wonder what the dispatched investigation team is examining. I really want to know their true identity soon.
^^^^
Looks like you've got a soft spot for Mayleaf.
^^^^
All right, I'll leave her in your hands from now on.
^^^^
You went through a lot of trouble. For now, there is nothing.
^^^^
Rest or play――do as you please.
^^^^
I've heard that you took action regarding the matter concerning Iris. I also want to say thank you. I appreciate your assistance.
^^^^
Is this okay―― Are we, the Arisen, fine as we are――
^^^^
The power of the White Dragon - If even a little can be inherited -
^^^^
No matter how unreasonable it may be, I wanted you to bring Mayleaf back... Well, it seems like now I have no choice but to believe in Kieshildt.
^^^^
Mayleaf is not an ordinary girl, so she wouldn't easily fall into the hands of enemies.
^^^^
If there is someone who betrays her trust, it's a different story...
^^^^
I'll take care of Iris. We've known each other a long time.
^^^^
Talk to him--you'll understand. Yeah--you'll understand.
^^^^
Whoever the elf mentioned in the enemy's conversation is, it's definitely Kieshildt. If they're being targeted, I can't just leave them alone.
^^^^
Mogok, you rotten scoundrel―― Don't think you'll get off easy.
^^^^
The death of Kieshildt is by no means in vain.
^^^^
As long as a life is dedicated to the White Dragon-- No one's life will be wasted.
^^^^
Diamantes--
^^^^
The man sent the Ark-- using Zuhl to gather the Orcs-- and took away Iris's sanity and Kieshildt's life--
^^^^
Who are you, Diamantes-- No, I've heard of you before. You're the one who turned Lestania from a prosperous world into a battlefield, The mastermind--
^^^^
Where are they - I'll take them down right now!
^^^^
I understand that Joseph is doing his best, but- understandably- he gets impatient.
^^^^
As an Arisen, I have never sought anything in return for living this way.
^^^^
What is this strike- what is it?
^^^^
What? Do I have something on my face?
^^^^
You look so concerned - what's troubling you?
^^^^
Fun times are limited, so it's worth it.
^^^^
I have the power So, it's only natural to use it - yes, naturally!
^^^^
I don't know, you know. What is right and what is wrong -
^^^^
Defeat the enemies and hunt the monsters―― If I become stronger, will I be able to see a different way of living?
^^^^
Well, what are you going to do? If you are Arisen, you shouldn't have any doubts, right?
^^^^
You have a similar expression to Leo, huh.
^^^^
You should have confidence. I think you can do it.
^^^^
In the end, you never know what will happen, you know? The world and all that.
^^^^
What?　What, what, what?
^^^^
You're quite good, aren't you? Maybe this will make things easier for me.
^^^^
By the way, have you met Fabio, the Arisen?
^^^^
He's a good guy, so remember him. Fabio, right, Fabio.
^^^^
Oh, I'm so busy-- Either someone's not being very helpful... Or maybe I'm just not very good at what I do.
^^^^
I'm sorry I can't help you. I'm busy with my own things.
^^^^
You're doing great already!  Yeah, sure!
^^^^
If you work hard, I'll be a little relieved!
^^^^
I'm excited, aren't you?
^^^^
Is it an important conversation? If not, please postpone it.
^^^^
Hmm, it looks like you have some free time, huh?
^^^^
If you have time, why don't you go and defeat some monsters outside?
^^^^
Without discipline, people will not work. There are no exceptions.
^^^^
The Arisen is someone who always bears responsibility. To the White Dragon, to the land, to the people— never forget that they serve everyone.
^^^^
Please do not indulge in your own power. Any warrior can easily get trapped in the quagmire of overconfidence.
^^^^
Arisen often tend to be a bunch of troublemakers, but... Don't let yourself be tainted by bad habits.
^^^^
Be prepared to die and not give up on life at the same time. That's the secret to survival on the battlefield. To face death and at the same time not give up on life, That is the secret to surviving on the battlefield.
^^^^
We must fight even against enemies beyond human understanding. That's what knighthood is all about!
^^^^
Even though they are awakened, they must obey military regulations. It is to protect the lives of their comrades.
^^^^
What?　What do you want with us Knights?
^^^^
Do not forget the etiquette In this 《Audience Chamber》, especially
^^^^
It seems that Lady Vanessa of Fort Gritten is coming-- Is the knights order out of the loop?
^^^^
The sacrifice of the knights will be rewarded with the power of the dragon - oh, indeed.
